<h2>Translator&rsquo;s Preface</h2>
<p>In tracing the career of Achilles in connection
with the Trojan war, that inimitable classic
story-teller, Carl Friedrich Becker, follows the
lines of Homer&rsquo;s Iliad. He gives the reader a graphic
picture of the stirring events in the ten years&rsquo; siege
maintained by the Greeks, under the leadership of
Agamemnon, king of Mycen&aelig;, in their finally successful
effort to redress the injury done to Menelaus,
king of Sparta, whose wife, Helen, was carried off
by Paris. The striking points in this thrilling narrative
are the quarrel between Agamemnon and
Achilles; the exploits of Hector, noblest character
of them all; the human impersonations of the gods,
who take part in the strife&mdash;some on one side, some
on the other; the death of Patroclus; the final
reconciliation of Achilles and Agamemnon and the
former&rsquo;s tremendous exploits; the death of Hector,
and the touching interview with the aged Priam,
who seeks to recover his body.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_vi">vi</div>
<p>The ultimate fate of Achilles and the fall of the
city are not told, nor the wretched end of Agamemnon,
who, according to &AElig;schylus, was killed by
Clytemnestra, the queen, upon his return. Hector
is one of the most conspicuous figures in this great
drama and appears only second to Achilles among
all the warriors. The exciting Trojan war story has
never been told more graphically or interestingly in
modern prose than in Becker&rsquo;s version. In adapting
it to the series of &ldquo;Life Stories&rdquo; the translator
has been obliged to abridge the original work somewhat,
but the parts omitted do not interfere with
the flow of the story.</p>

<p>Troy was a small portion of that section of
Asia Minor which was later called Phrygia.
Its northern coast touched the entrance
to the Hellespont. It was very densely populated
and had, besides many little plantations, villages,
and settlements of farmers or herdsmen, a large city
with a strong wall, towers, and gates. Homer never
called the city Troy, but always Ilios or Ilium.
The surroundings he calls Troy and the inhabitants
Trojans, after an ancestor named Tros, who was
said to have founded the city. He describes them
as a bold, enterprising people, who lived in a high
degree of comfort and practised many arts of which
the Europeans of that time were ignorant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>The Achaians, as Homer calls the inhabitants of
Greece, and the Trojans, engaged in mutual depredations
upon each other&rsquo;s property,&mdash;until at last
the long-standing national hatred broke out violently
through the fault of the Trojans. Alexandros, or
Paris, one of the sons of the old Trojan king, Priam,
sailed across to Europe and paid a visit to King
Menelaus, ruler over several cities in Sparta. He
was hospitably received and entertained for many
days, but repaid his good host with most shameless
ingratitude. He persuaded the queen, the beautiful
Helen, to forget her duty and flee with him. Menelaus
sought revenge and called upon his brother
Agamemnon, ruler over Mycen&aelig;, old Nestor of
Pylos, Ulysses of Ithaca, and many other valiant
princes to ally themselves with him. A number of
young lords who had long been wishing to take part
in some glorious enterprise, like the expedition of
the Argonauts, of which their fathers had so much
to tell, offered their services with innumerable
followers.</p>
<p>News of the mighty campaign which was being
arranged spread throughout Greece, causing great
rejoicing. Everyone looked upon it as a great
opportunity and an event in which it would be
shameful not to take part. A whole year passed in
preparing the equipments. In the meanwhile Nestor
and Ulysses travelled about everywhere to persuade
the princes of Greece and its neighboring
islands, who had hesitated hitherto, not to miss their
share in the honors and spoils which so brilliant a
campaign was sure to afford. For the object was
nothing less than the destruction of the celebrated
city of Troy, and the booty which was to be expected
from such a rich people was incalculable.
They had excellent success on this recruiting expedition,
calling upon Peleus, father of Achilles in
Thessalia, King Idomeneus in Crete, old Telamon
in Salamis, and others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>The harbor of Aulis in B&oelig;otia was selected for
the place of meeting and at the appointed time more
than one thousand ships assembled, with men from
all parts of Greece. They agreed to offer the command
to Agamemnon, one of the foremost among
the princes, partly because he had brought the
largest following and partly because he and his
brother had organized the campaign. He was,
besides, a clever and honorable man and a brave
warrior, although considerably inferior in physical
strength to Achilles, the invincible.</p>
<p>All was ready for departure, but the ships waited
in vain for a favorable wind. It was supposed that
some god was delaying the voyage and that he must
be propitiated by an offering, so the priest Calchas
was commanded to consult the oracle. After observing
the usual signs he announced that Agamemnon
had slain a sacred animal in the chase, thereby
offending Artemis, who now demanded a human
sacrifice in the shape of Agamemnon&rsquo;s eldest daughter,
Iphigenia. She was accordingly brought to the
altar, but Artemis relented at the moment when the
fatal stroke was about to be given, removed the trembling
maiden in a dense cloud, and put an animal in
her place. When Iphigenia awoke from her swoon,
she found herself in the temple of Artemis in Taurus,
where she served for a long time as priestess.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>The same day, after this sacrifice, a favorable
wind swelled the sails and the impatient heroes
boarded their ships. In a few days the fleet arrived
at Troy. On the way they had stopped to plunder
a few cities on the islands of Scyros and Lesbos,
had killed the men, and taken the women on board
as slaves. After landing they proceeded in the same
manner in the country about Troy. At the end of
the war the godlike Achilles boasted that he alone
with his Myrmidons had conquered twelve rich
cities by sea and eleven by land in the Trojan territory.
The booty which each skirmishing party
brought in to camp was divided and the chief always
received the best of everything. The inhabitants
of the capital were safe behind their walls, and as
the Greek forces were seldom united, the Trojans
were often able, by a sudden sortie, to repulse the
attacking parties which ventured too near the gates.
This desultory warfare continued for several years,
until many of the Achaians began to long for home.
But they were ashamed to depart thus, without
having accomplished their object. The leaders concentrated
their men and began the siege in earnest.</p>
<p>The Trojans now took measures for more careful
defence and sent to the neighboring peoples to
demand their aid. Many princes responded to the
call with their followers, until they had formed an
alliance equal in strength to the Achaians. In the
tenth year of the siege fortune seemed to have
turned her back on the Greeks, for besides the hardships
of war, they had to contend with a pestilence,
and finally were nearly destroyed by the Trojans,
while their two mightiest chiefs, Agamemnon and
Achilles, were quarrelling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Agamemnon had plundered a city and had taken
Chryse&iuml;s, daughter of a priest of Apollo, for his
slave. In the same way Achilles had become
possessed of a maid named Brise&iuml;s, to whom he
became so attached that he wished to keep her
always with him. After a time the priest appeared
in the Greek camp with rich presents to ransom his
daughter, but Agamemnon did not wish to give up
the maiden and returned a harsh answer. The
Greeks urged him to release the maid out of respect
for the priest and for fear of Apollo&rsquo;s wrath, but the
obstinate man refused to listen to reason and bade
the father depart on pain of chastisement. With
loud lamentations the old man retired to the seacoast
and prayed to Apollo. The legend tells us
that Apollo at once left Olympus, seated himself
at some distance from the ships, and began to shoot
his arrows into the Greek camp. Whatever was
struck died a sudden death by the plague. First
the donkeys and dogs and then the men fell victims.
The pestilence raged for nine days, during which the
funeral pyres burned incessantly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>This filled the leaders with great apprehension,
so that on the tenth day Achilles summoned a folk
assembly and advised the people to call upon the
seer Calchas to discover what fault of the army had
brought this woe upon them and by means of what
sacrifice the god might be appeased. Calchas
hesitated, but at length answered that he knew the
reason, but feared to give it until the bravest among
the heroes had sworn to protect him in case a man
of great power among the Achaians should be angry
at his decree. Then Achilles stood up and made a
public vow to protect him, even though the man he
meant were Agamemnon, mightiest of the Greeks.
&ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; replied Calchas, &ldquo;I will declare
the truth. Yes, it is Agamemnon with whom Apollo
is angry, for he has dishonored his priest and has
refused to restore his daughter to him. Therefore
hath he sent this punishment upon us and we cannot
escape it until the maiden shall be returned freely
to her father and a rich sacrifice has been offered
to the god upon his holy altar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Agamemnon, trembling with rage, cried: &ldquo;Miserable
seer, must I do penance for the people&rsquo;s sins?
The maiden is wise and well trained in feminine
tasks. I prize her above my spouse, Clytemnestra,
and must I give her up? Let it be so; take her! I
will bear even more than this for the people&rsquo;s good.
But I tell you, ye must provide another gift in her
place, for she was my share of the booty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Avaricious, insatiable man,&rdquo; answered Achilles,
&ldquo;what dost thou demand? I knew not that we had
treasures in reserve. Therefore be patient until
the gods aid us to conquer rich Troy. Then thou
mayst replace thy treasure many times over.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>Although this speech was just, the angry man
imagined that it was intended in mockery and he
cried: &ldquo;Not so, Achilles; strong and brave as thou
art, thou shalt not intimidate me! Dost thou expect
to keep thy spoils and the others theirs, while
mine is taken from me? I tell thee, if I receive no
compensation, I will myself take it from thy tent
or those of Ulysses or of Ajax, or wherever I please,
and let him whom I despoil avenge himself. Take
now the maiden, put her aboard the ship, together
with the sacrificial steer, and row her to Chryse,
where her father lives, that the god may no longer be
angry with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This speech infuriated Achilles and he cried
angrily: &ldquo;What! Thou wouldst take away my
prize? Did we march against the Trojans for our
own sakes? Not I, indeed! They never injured
me, nor ever robbed me of a horse or cow, nor pillaged
my newly sown fields. I was well protected by
wooded hills and the broad sea and never thought
of Troy in my Phthian home. It was solely on thy
account, thou selfish, shameless man, that I came
hither to avenge thine and thy brother&rsquo;s sullied
honor. And this hast thou so speedily forgotten and
threatenest even to take away the spoils which the
Achaians have unanimously accorded me and which
I have honestly earned? Have I not hitherto borne
the chief burden of the war? Who has fought as
much as I? Let him appear! And when have I
received prizes like thine? Thou hast always taken
the best of everything, while I have contented myself
with little. Very well! Thou mayest fight
alone! I return to Phthia!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fly, if thy heart bids thee!&rdquo; flashed forth Agamemnon
in anger. &ldquo;Truly I shall not beg thee to
remain. There are other warriors here through
whom Jupiter will help me to achieve honor. Thou
hast been obnoxious to me from the beginning.
Thou hast ever loved quarrelling and strife and hast
never kept peace. Thy strength hath been given
thee by the gods and thou dost pride thyself altogether
too much upon it. Thou mayest sail away with
all thy followers and rule peacefully over thy Myrmidons.
Thy wrath is nothing to me. But I tell thee,
that as Ph&oelig;bus Apollo has taken Chryse&rsquo;s daughter
from me, I shall take from thee the rosy daughter of
Brise&iuml;s, thy prize, so that thou mayest learn how much
more powerful I am than thou, and that no other in
future shall dare to defy me as thou hast done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a rage Achilles drew his shining sword from its
scabbard to cut down Agamemnon. Suddenly,
unseen by all the rest, the goddess Athena stood
behind him and whispered to him not to draw his
sword against the king, but that he might scold as
much as he pleased. &ldquo;Thy word I must obey, oh
goddess,&rdquo; answered Achilles, &ldquo;though anger fills my
heart. The gods attend those who follow their
counsel.&rdquo; With these words he returned his sword
to its scabbard, but turning to Agamemnon he cried:
&ldquo;Thou miserable drunkard, with the look of a dog
and the courage of a hare! Never hast thou dared to
risk a decisive battle or to lie in ambush with the
other nobles; but it is more comfortable to take
away his prize from the single man who opposes
thee. I swear that thou shalt never again see me
raise my arm against the Trojans, though all thy
Achaians should perish and thou shouldst beseech
me on thy knees to save thee.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>Thus he spake, and dashing his sceptre upon the
ground, sat down in silence. Agamemnon was preparing
to answer this passionate speech when up
rose old Nestor, reverenced like a father by everyone
for his age, wisdom, and experience. When it
was seen that he wished to speak all were quiet.
Even Agamemnon bridled his anger, and the well-meaning
old man began: &ldquo;Dear friends, what are
you about! What an unhappy fate do ye bring
upon us all! How Priam, his sons, and the whole
Trojan people will rejoice when they hear that the
foremost Achaians are quarrelling. Listen to me,
for ye are all much younger than I. However much
power the Achaians have given thee, Agamemnon,
do not abuse it. Let Achilles keep the prize with
which the Achaians have rewarded him. And thou,
Achilles, do not defy the king, for never has Jupiter
crowned a king with such honor as this one. Though
thou art stronger than he and boastest thyself of
divine ancestry, he is the more powerful and all the
people obey him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly, honorable father,&rdquo; answered Agamemnon,
&ldquo;thou hast spoken worthily. But this man is unreasonable;
he wishes to be above all others, to rule
all, to make laws for all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>Achilles interrupted him. &ldquo;Indeed I should be
a coward did I submit to all thy insults. I will keep
the vow I have sworn. One thing I will say&mdash;if
the Achaians wish the maiden they have given me,
they may have her. But woe to thee if thou layest
hands upon my other spoils.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Agamemnon insisted on taking the maiden, and
he had the power to carry out his threats. Wisdom
counselled Achilles to surrender what he was not
strong enough to hold. He withdrew from the
quarrel with more dignity than his unjust enemy,
and his threat of abandoning the war gave him
ample satisfaction. The result proved his value.
He had thus far been the only one able to vanquish
Hector, Priam&rsquo;s most valiant son; and now that he
had withdrawn, it was the Trojans, day after day,
who were the victors. It seemed as though a god
had doomed the Greeks to destruction.</p>
<p>Agamemnon first sent Ulysses to conduct his
slave and the appointed animals for the sacrifice
to her father&rsquo;s home. Next he called upon two
heralds to fetch the beautiful Brise&iuml;s from Achilles&rsquo;
tent. They obeyed his command in fear and trembling.
But Achilles banished their fears, saying:
&ldquo;Come hither, ye sacred messengers and peace be
with ye. For ye are not to blame, but he who sends
ye. He shall have the maid. Go, Patroclus, and
fetch her out. Ye are all witnesses before gods and
men that I have sworn never to lift a hand again
for Agamemnon against Troy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They received the maid from the hands of his
friend, Patroclus, and she went reluctantly away
with them, often glancing sorrowfully backward
toward the tent of her former beloved master.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">Thetis Promises to Aid the Angry Achilles and Begs Jupiter&rsquo;s Assistance&mdash;Juno is Angry&mdash;Agamemnon and the Other Princes Summon the Greeks to Battle</span></h2>
<p>Achilles gazed gloomily after the men, then
arose quickly and seated himself far from his
companions on the beach, looking moodily
out over the dark waters. He bethought him of his
mother, Thetis, who lived in the blue depths of the sea,
spread out his arms, and prayed to her for aid. She
heard him and hastened to appear. Floating over
the sea like a cloud, she seated herself beside her
weeping son and tenderly caressed him. &ldquo;Dear
son, why dost thou weep?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;What
troubles thee? Speak! Conceal nothing from me.&rdquo;
With deep sighs he related what had happened to
him, begging his mother to avenge his wrongs and
to intercede for him with Jupiter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>It was early on the twelfth day since Achilles had
retired from the fray when Thetis rose from the
dark waves and ascended the heights of Olympus.
She found the mighty Jupiter seated on the summit
of the mountain, apart from the other gods, bowed
herself before him, embraced his knees with her left
hand, and caressed his chin with her right hand.
&ldquo;Father Jupiter,&rdquo; she said coaxingly, &ldquo;if thou lovest
me, grant me a boon and show favor to my son, who
has but a short life to live. Give him redress against
Agamemnon and let the Trojans prevail, until the
Achaians shall be obliged to recompense him with
redoubled honors, for this base insult.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The father of the gods and men began dejectedly:
&ldquo;Thou wilt involve me in strife and enmity with
Juno. Even now she quarrels with me and says I
am aiding the Trojans. Leave me quickly, that she
may not see thee, and I will grant thy request with
a nod.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The goddess descended from the shining heights
of Olympus into the depths of the sea, while Jupiter
arose and went to his palace. When the gods saw
him coming they all left their places and went
respectfully to meet him. He approached the throne
and seated himself. But his jealous consort had
noticed Thetis and began straightway to pick a
quarrel with him. &ldquo;Yes, I saw the silver-footed
Thetis at thy knee, saw thy nod, and saw her depart
content. Doubtless thou art about to honor Achilles
once more, castigate the Achaians, and protect the
insolent Trojans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou art continually spying upon me,&rdquo; answered
the ruler. &ldquo;But it shall do thee no good&mdash;I do as I
please. Therefore sit still and be silent, for shouldst
thou arouse my anger, all the immortals together
could not save thee from my powerful hands.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>Thus spake the Thunderer, and Juno was frightened.
All the gods were sorry for her, especially
Heph&aelig;stus, the artist god of fire; for she was his
mother, and he had already learned that Jove&rsquo;s
threats often received terrible fulfilment. He began
in his mother&rsquo;s behalf: &ldquo;It is intolerable that thou
shouldst quarrel over mortals. I admonish thee,
mother, to bear thyself acceptably, that our father
may be content and our feast be undisturbed.&rdquo;
He took his goblet, and handing it to his mother,
said: &ldquo;Be patient, dear mother, even though grieved
at heart, that I may not have to look upon thy
punishment. Once before when he struck thee and
I attempted to restrain him, he took me by the heel
and cast me down into the air, so that I fell for a
whole day before I struck the earth, and I have
limped ever since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mother smiled and took the cup, and Heph&aelig;stus
filled the goblets of the other gods. Then
Apollo with his muses broke forth in sweet song,
and thus the day passed among the immortals in
blissful contentment. When Helios had put out
his flaming torch, each went to his dwelling to rest.
Jove was the only one whom sleep fled. He meditated
anxiously how he might favor Achilles by
defeating the Greeks. He sent a deceptive dream
to Agamemnon, telling him to prepare for battle
and that it would be easy for him to conquer the
city. As soon as he awoke, Agamemnon told the
other princes of his dream. The assembly was
called together. Agamemnon was uncertain whether
he dared call upon the discontented army, and
wishing first to feel his way, he began to talk of their
return. &ldquo;Here we have lain for ten years,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;The ships are rotting, the anchor ropes are mouldering,
and we have as yet accomplished nothing.
Indeed the gods seem to be against us. Therefore
my advice is that we quickly put to sea and sail for
home before the Trojans do us a greater mischief.
You all must see that we cannot take the city.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>He had scarcely ended when the whole company
rushed exultantly away to the ships, for all were
anxious to return to their homes. This was more
than the king had expected and he looked on in
despair, while the other brave leaders gnashed their
teeth. They were powerless to stay the tumultuous
rabble until Ulysses, hurrying forward with quick
presence of mind, admonished leaders and men to
return to the assembly. &ldquo;Do not be in such a
hurry,&rdquo; he would say when he met one of the princes;
&ldquo;hear the end. Thou dost not know the king&rsquo;s
mind yet. He but wished to test us, and woe to
thee if the mighty king&rsquo;s wrath overtake thee.&rdquo;
Then he drove the people back, and they came with
a roar like angry waves breaking on a rocky shore.
They knew Ulysses&rsquo; warlike spirit and feared he
might advise renewal of the struggle. Only respect
for his great authority moved them to return.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>When all the princes were seated and order had
once more been restored, Ulysses was about to take
up the sceptre. Suddenly Thersites pushed forward.
He was despised by the whole army as a
quarrelsome, insolent fellow, who seldom let an
opportunity go by to insult the princes, not excepting
Agamemnon himself, with mocking, rebellious words.
He was the ugliest of all the Greeks, having a lame
foot, a deformed shoulder, a pointed, bald head,
and a cast in one eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What wilt thou now, Atreus&rsquo; son?&rdquo; he shrieked
at Agamemnon. &ldquo;I should have thought thou
hadst collected enough money and valuable spoils
to have satisfied thy avarice. Dost thou desire
still more? Must the Achaians still sacrifice themselves
to fill thy insatiable throat? Are ye not
ashamed, ye princes, to suffer such a king to lead ye
to destruction? But ye are women or ye would
desert him and embark without him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence, foolish babbler!&rdquo; cried Ulysses. &ldquo;If I
ever again hear thee slander one of us so shamelessly,
true as I live, I will tear thy clothes from thy
body and whip thee out of the assembly so that the
whole camp shall hear thy cries!&rdquo; Thus spake the
hero, beating him about the back and shoulders
with the sceptre, so that he cowered down and then
ran away crying out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>The heralds now commanded silence as Ulysses
again stood up to speak. Turning to Agamemnon
he said: &ldquo;Oh son of Atreus, how badly have the
Achaians kept faith with thee. They promised not
to return home until we had conquered Troy, and
now they act like children. I do not blame anyone
for longing for his home after ten years of absence.
But just because we have waited so long, it were a
shame to return when we are so near the goal. For
we must succeed or all the signs of the immortal
Jove are a mockery. Did not Calchas tell us, back
in Aulis, how it would be? Do ye not remember the
sparrow&rsquo;s nest in the beautiful maple tree near our
altar? I can still see the spotted serpent gliding up
its trunk and swallowing the eight young birds and
catching the frightened mother bird at last by the
wing. We were all alarmed at the omen, but
Calchas interpreted the occurrence favorably. He
said: &lsquo;The war shall consume nine years, but in the
tenth, Troy shall fall.&rsquo; Behold, friends, the prophecy
is about to be fulfilled, and will ye now flee?
Wait but a short time until we have taken the proud
city of Priam, and then let us depart laden with rich
booty and crowned with immortal glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Nestor next arose to persuade those who still
hesitated. &ldquo;That is right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let reason
speak to you. Shall our great plans go up in smoke
and shall our sacred vows to Menelaus and his good
brother, Agamemnon, be broken? Indeed no! Lead
the Achaians into battle, great king, and most of
them will, I hope, cheerfully follow thee. Let the
men be gathered together by tribes, that each may
fight for his own blood. Then thou shalt clearly
see whether the gods protect the city or whether it
is the cowardice and ignorance of our army which
defeats us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well spoken!&rdquo; cried Agamemnon. &ldquo;We must
not rest until the fortress is taken. Jove will surely
aid us. His flashing lightnings as we left Aulis are
the surest pledge of this. The city would already
be ours had I ten men in my army as wise as thou
art, O Nestor, and alas! had Achilles not left us&mdash;Achilles,
whom I have wounded so sorely. But
come! Let everyone prepare for the battle. Let
us quickly refresh and strengthen ourselves and then
advance upon the city in a body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words he dismissed the assembly and
the people streamed back to the tents to arm themselves
and take some food. The king invited all
the chiefs to join him at breakfast in his tent. Nestor,
Idomeneus, the two brave Ajaxes, Diomedes,
and Ulysses were there, besides his brother Menelaus.
They took a steer, strewing sacred barley upon it,
and while they all stood about it in a circle, Agamemnon
lifted up his voice and prayed to Jupiter for
victory. Alas! he did not know that the god had
turned against him.</p>
<p>The drivers harnessed their horses, the warriors
donned helmet and shield and took up their lances,
and the heralds lifted up their mighty voices above
the din, to call the stragglers together. Company
after company, they assembled like a swarm of
migrating birds. Then the princes hastily mustered
the ranks and arranged the races and tribes as
Nestor had advised. But the king called to them
in a loud voice to fight bravely, and when all was in
readiness they swept forwards with a din and outcry,
like a flock of screeching cranes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">Chapter III</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Meeting of the Armies&mdash;Menelaus and Paris&mdash;Agamemnon Leads the Greeks into Battle</span></h2>
<p>The Trojan nobles were holding a council
of war before the palace when Iris, a
messenger from Jupiter, appearing in the
shape of Priam&rsquo;s son Polites, joined them. He came
from one of the watch towers and brought the news
that an incalculable number of Achaians was approaching.
Hastily the council broke up, each
chief going to assemble his people, that they might
be ready to meet the Greeks before they should
reach the city wall. In their midst were many
heroes, but distinguished amongst them all for
invincible strength and heroic courage were Hector,
son of Priam, several of his brothers, and also &AElig;neas,
a connection of the royal house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>Masses of men now poured out of the open city
gates and ranged themselves in long lines of battle.
The Achaians advanced ever nearer, but could not
be distinguished for the tremendous dust which
arose before them, enveloping them like a cloud.
When they came to a standstill the leaders at last
recognized one another. In front of the Trojans
marched the godlike Paris, wearing a leopard skin,
his bow slung over his shoulder, his sword on his
thigh, and swinging two javelins in his right hand.
With mocking words he challenged the bravest
Achaians to combat. His arch-enemy, Menelaus,
was the first to hear him and his heart swelled with
anger, while he burned to meet the robber of his
honor. He guided his chariot toward him, sprang
hastily down, and ran to meet him, eager as a lion
to spring upon its prey. The handsome youth was
frightened at his appearance and fled, vanishing
among the throng of Trojans.</p>
<p>His brother Hector saw his flight and was indignant
at the sight. &ldquo;Coward,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;would
that thou hadst never been born or else hadst died
ere ever thou didst learn to seduce women! Now
thou hast made a laughing-stock of thyself before
both armies. I can only wonder how thou hadst
ever the courage to go to a foreign land and there
to steal away a beautiful woman. The deed has
been the undoing of us all and brought eternal shame
upon thyself. Menelaus appears quite different to
thee to-day, I suppose, from what he did then?
Had he caught thee, thy lute and curled hair, thy
slender shape, and the favor of Aphrodite had
availed thee little. Were the Trojans not a cowardly
rabble thou wouldst long ago have paid the penalty
for all thou hast brought upon them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>Paris answered: &ldquo;Thou art right, brother. But
forgive me. Wouldst thou see me fight, bid the
others cease and let me challenge Menelaus to
single combat before the people. Then let whichever
is the victor take Helen, with all the other
treasures, that the Trojans and Achaians may part
in peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words pleased Hector and he advanced,
holding out his lance before the Greeks and calling
upon them to cease fighting. The arrows of the
enemy fell about him like rain until Agamemnon
spied him and cried loudly: &ldquo;Stop, men! Do not
shoot, for he wishes to speak to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hector called out: &ldquo;Hear me now, Achaians and
Trojans! Paris, my brother, the cause of all this
trouble, would also make an end of it and challenges
Menelaus to single combat. Whichever wins shall
take both Helen and the treasure and the death of
the vanquished shall end the war. Ye shall all
return to your homes and we will swear a bond of
friendship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Menelaus listened, well pleased, and stepped
forth to accept the challenge, only stipulating that
a solemn pledge should be taken with all the customary
sacrifices and observances and that King
Priam should himself be present at the combat.
All this was willingly granted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>In the meanwhile Agamemnon and Hector sent
for the lambs and goats for the sacrifice. Priam
was seated upon the city wall near the Sc&aelig;an gate
with the elders who were no longer able to go into
battle, and there the message was brought him by
a herald. Helen also received the message, which she
heard with pleasure, hoping in her heart that Menelaus
might be the victor; for she had begun to long
for her former husband, her native city, and old
friends. She hastily wrapped herself in a silvery
veil of linen and hurried away to the Sc&aelig;an gate,
accompanied by two female attendants. The aged
men at the tower were entranced with her beauty
and compared her to one of the immortal goddesses.
Priam welcomed her kindly, saying: &ldquo;Approach,
my daughter. Sit here beside me, that thou mayest
see all thy dear relatives and thy former husband.
Do not weep. It is not thy fault. It is the immortal
gods who have sent us this unhappy war.
But tell me, who is that stately man who stands out
amongst all the others, so noble and commanding
in appearance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How kind thou art, gracious father, and how
unhappy am I!&rdquo; answered Helen. &ldquo;Would I had
died ere I followed thy son hither. That stately
hero of whom thou speakest is Agamemnon, the
powerful king of Mycen&aelig;. He was my brother-in-law.
Alas! would that he were now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that is Agamemnon!&rdquo; replied Priam slowly,
observing him with admiration. &ldquo;But tell me more.
I see one who is not so tall, but with broad chest
and mighty shoulders. He has laid his weapons
upon the ground and goes among the soldiers, from
one company to another, even as a ram musters the
flock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is Ulysses, La&euml;rtes&rsquo; son,&rdquo; said Helen; &ldquo;a
good soldier and the wisest of them all in council.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is true, and now I recognize him myself,&rdquo;
said Antenor. &ldquo;He came with Menelaus into the
city, as ambassador from the Achaians, to make
terms for thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look!&rdquo; cried Priam. &ldquo;There go two others,
who appear to be powerful kings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly they are valiant heroes,&rdquo; answered Helen.
&ldquo;The first is Ajax of Salamis and the other Idomeneus,
king of Crete. He often visited us and
Menelaus entertained him gladly, for he is an
excellent man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While this conversation was going on, there came
a herald to the aged king to announce that the
chariot was waiting to take him to the battlefield.
On their arrival in the midst of the two armies,
Agamemnon advanced to meet the king, surrounded
by the other princes. Heralds went among the
company, sprinkling the hands of each with water;
for none might perform a sacred rite with unclean
hands. Then Agamemnon drew a great knife from
his belt and sheared the wool from the lambs&rsquo; heads
and the heralds gave a piece of it to each prince.
Then Agamemnon lifted up his hands and prayed:
&ldquo;Father Jupiter, glorious ruler, and thou, Helios,
all-seeing sungod; ye Streams and Earth and ye
Shades who punish those who swear falsely, be ye
witnesses of our vows and of this solemn treaty.
If Paris vanquish King Menelaus, he shall keep
Helen and her treasures and we will return to our
country. But if he fall in the fight, the Trojans
shall give up the woman, together with all the
treasure, and pay us besides a fair tribute in this
and future years. And should they ever refuse to
fulfil this vow, I shall renew the war and never stop
until I have received full satisfaction.&rdquo; All took
the oath and the king cut the throats of the lambs
and laid them down upon the ground. Then each
took wine and poured the first drops upon the earth
in honor of the gods, saying: &ldquo;May Jupiter thus
spill the blood of him who shall first break the sacred
oath.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;Worthy men,&rdquo; said old Priam, with tears in his
eyes, &ldquo;grant me leave to return home that I may
not look upon the combat. Let Jupiter decide.
He knoweth best the right.&rdquo; With these words he
was lifted into his chariot and Antenor drove him
swiftly to the palace.</p>
<p>Hector and Ulysses, the arbiters of the combat,
now measured off the ground and put the lots in a
helmet, one for Menelaus and one for Paris, in order
to decide who should first cast his spear. Hector
shook the helmet until one of the lots flew out. It
was that of Paris. The bystanders at once retired
to a distance and seated themselves in a circle.
Paris, in shining armor and carrying a heavy javelin,
advanced from one side and Menelaus from the other
into the middle of the arena. They shook their
weapons fiercely and Paris was the first to cast his
javelin. But he struck only the edge of Menelaus&rsquo;
shield; the point was bent and the spear fell harmless
to the ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>Menelaus cast his spear with such force that it
pierced the shield and would have penetrated his
heart had Paris not quickly sprung aside. But while
he was gazing in dismay at the wreck of his shield,
Menelaus sprang upon him with drawn sword and
had cloven his head in twain had not the thick
helmet shivered the brittle blade. For the third
time he sprang at Paris and seized him by the helmet
to throw him to the ground, but at the same moment
the chin strap broke and Menelaus&rsquo; arm flew up and
he found himself holding the empty helmet in his
hand. Paris took the opportunity to rush away
and take refuge among the Trojans, and when
Menelaus turned to cast his spear a second time at
him, he had already disappeared. It was the
friendly goddess Aphrodite who had saved him.</p>
<p>While the Greeks were loudly acclaiming the
victor, Jupiter put it into the heart of a Trojan to
shoot an arrow at Menelaus. Pandarus was the
man&rsquo;s name and Athena herself had put the arrow
into his hands just as Menelaus passed under the
city wall. But the wound was not dangerous and
was quickly dressed by Machaon with a salve which
he always carried about him. The victorious cries
of the Achaians now changed to cries of rage. All
condemned the treacherous act and called down the
vengeance of Jupiter upon the Trojan people.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>Agamemnon assembled his cohorts once more and
hastened among the ranks encouraging, threatening.
Brave Idomeneus he found ready armed amongst
his Cretans. Next he mustered the tribes under
command of the two Ajaxes, which were ready to
go into battle. The next company that he met
were the Pylians, under the command of young
princes whom old Nestor directed. The old man
was even now going about among the men, restraining
the horsemen and placing the weaker in the
middle, with the more courageous and experienced
at the front and on the sides, and giving much
valuable advice to the young leaders. Well pleased,
Agamemnon hurried on to the Athenians and
Cephallenians, led by Menestheus and Ulysses. He
found the two chieftains conversing unconcernedly
together and called to them: &ldquo;Is this the interest
ye take in the war? All the rest are armed and
ready and would ye be left behind? Ye are always
foremost at the banquet and now ye look on while
ten companies of Achaians enter the battlefield
before ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulysses answered, darkly frowning: &ldquo;What words
are these, oh ruler? When hast thou ever found us
tardy in battle? When the fight begins we shall
not be far away, and thou shalt see the father of
Telemachus at the front amongst the Trojan horsemen.
Those were empty words thou spakest!&rdquo;
Smiling at his anger Agamemnon answered: &ldquo;Noble
son of La&euml;rtes, thou needest no advice nor blame
from me, for we are of one mind. Let it be forgotten
if I have spoken harshly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hastened to the next company, where he found
Diomedes and Sthenelus standing together in their
chariot, the former with sad and disheartened mien.
&ldquo;What, son of Tydeus!&rdquo; he said to him, &ldquo;thou
seemest disturbed and art trembling. Thy noble
father knew no fear. What deeds that man accomplished!
His son is less heroic in battle, though
more ready of tongue.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;Speak not falsely, Atride,&rdquo; answered Sthenelus,
as Diomedes bowed respectfully under the king&rsquo;s
reproaches. &ldquo;We boast ourselves braver than our
fathers, for they led many foot-soldiers and horsemen
to Thebes and failed to take the city, while we
stormed it with but few followers. Do not praise
our fathers at our expense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence, friend,&rdquo; interrupted Diomedes. &ldquo;I do
not blame Agamemnon for inciting the Achaians to
battle. The fame and gain will be his if the war is
ended gloriously, and his the disgrace and ruin should
the Achaians be put to flight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words he sprang from the chariot, so
that his bronze harness rattled, and began to arm
himself for the fight. Agamemnon passed on.
While he was mustering the right wing, the left
advanced to the attack. They moved slowly and
silently forward, enveloped in a cloud of dust. At
last Achaians and Trojans met; shield rang against
shield, lance broke lance. Now loud shouts arose,
and mingled with the battle cries were heard the
groans of the wounded and dying being dragged
away by their friends, that they might not be
trampled upon or subjected to the cruelties of the
enemy. Above the din of battle rose the commands
of the chieftains and the cries of the soldiers. Swords
hissed through the air, spears whistled, shields rang
against one another.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>Hector, seeing his companions give way, called to
them: &ldquo;Forward, Trojan horsemen! Come, do not
leave the field to the Argives. They are made
neither of iron nor stone that our spears should
rebound from them, and Achilles, the great hero,
no longer fights in their ranks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Trojans took courage at this and renewed the
battle. Diores, the Greek, was stretched senseless
upon the ground by a heavy stone, and just as his
conqueror, the Trojan Peirus, had given him the
deathblow with his spear and was about to strip his
victim, Thoas the &AElig;tolian rushed upon him with
his sword and he fell across the body of Diores.
But Thoas was obliged to flee in turn, for the Trojans
ran up to carry off Peirus, and he had to seek other
booty. It had been a hot day and horse and rider
were panting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">Chapter IV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Continuation of the Battle&mdash;The Gods Take Part</span></h2>
<p>The sun stood high in the heavens and the
battle continued to rage with the greatest
bitterness. Hector and &AElig;neas, Agamemnon,
Ulysses, and the other great heroes raged about
the broad battlefield like beasts of prey. Diomedes
was especially favored by Athena on this great day
and laid many warriors in the dust. Among the
Trojans, two sons of the rich and pious priest of
Vulcan, Dares, spurred forward from the swarm of
warriors against him. One of them cast his spear
at the hero, but missed the mark, which but served
to enrage the warrior. He grimly cast back at the
youth and pierced him through the heart. His
brother turned and fled and Diomedes quickly
seized the handsome steeds and commanded his
men to conduct them to the ships.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>One could not tell to which side Diomedes belonged,
for he was always in the midst of the fight.
He was at last espied by Pandarus, the same who
had broken the oath by shooting at Menelaus. He
approached Diomedes stealthily from behind and
shot a sharp arrow into his right shoulder, so that
blood stained his coat of mail. &ldquo;Come, ye Trojans,&rdquo;
he cried, &ldquo;I have wounded the most formidable of
the Achaians.&rdquo; But the arrow had not penetrated
so deeply as he thought. Diomedes sought his
charioteer Sthenelus. &ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;come
quickly and pluck this arrow from my shoulder.&rdquo;
As it was withdrawn, blood spurted from the wound
and the warrior prayed to Athena: &ldquo;Hear me,
goddess, and as thou hast ever been my protector
in battle, oh aid me now and let me slay the man
who hath wounded me and boasts that I shall not
much longer see the light of day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The goddess heard him and stanched the blood.
&ldquo;Thou canst return to the fight,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have
endowed thee with the strength and courage of thy
father and will distinguish thee to-day above all
other Achaians. Only take care not to oppose the
immortal gods in battle, but attack all others
courageously. If Jupiter&rsquo;s daughter Aphrodite
should enter the field, thou mayest wound her with
thy sharp spear.&rdquo; The goddess disappeared and
Diomedes flew back to the foremost ranks with
renewed ardor. Behind him came his followers,
ready to strip his victims of their armor and to carry
away the captured horses and chariots. &AElig;neas called
upon Pandarus and said: &ldquo;Where are to-day thy
bow and never-failing arrows? Here is a chance to
distinguish thyself. See, there is a man who has
slain many, and none of our warriors can prevail
against him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is Diomedes, son of Tydeus,&rdquo; interrupted
Pandarus; &ldquo;he must be under the protection of a
god. Already my arrow has wounded him so that
blood spurted from the place, and in spite of this he
is again in the field wielding his deadly lance. I
dare not aim at him again, for it is unlucky to contend
with the gods. Besides, I came on foot to
Ilium and have no horses or chariot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, friend, take mine and learn what Trojan
horses are. Here, take the whip and reins, while I
remain on foot and watch the fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do thou guide the steeds thyself, &AElig;neas, for
they know thee; else might Diomedes take them
captive and slay us too. I will meet him with the
point of my sharp spear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together they mounted the handsome chariot
and dashed toward Diomedes, who was driving
across the field with Sthenelus. &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; cried
Sthenelus. &ldquo;There come two heroes making for us.
Let me turn back, for they seem bold warriors, and
thou art weary with long fighting and thy painful
wound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; said Diomedes angrily. &ldquo;It is not my
custom thus to flee. I will await them here, and if
one of them escape, the other shall be my prey.
Do thou follow me, and if I should wound them
both, seize thou the enemy&rsquo;s steeds. I know them.
They are magnificent horses of the famous breed
which Jupiter once gave to King Thoas for his
captured son Ganymede. Hasten, for the chariot
is already upon us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>He swung himself to the ground and at the same
moment Pandarus&rsquo; arrow struck his shield, and
though it made him stagger, he shook the shield in
Pandarus&rsquo; face and cried: &ldquo;Do not triumph too
soon, but rather take care that thou thyself escape
death!&rdquo; &AElig;neas turned his steeds in terror, but
he could not save his friend; Diomedes&rsquo; spear
had struck him down. As &AElig;neas descended to
bear away the body, he too was sorely wounded.
Sthenelus meanwhile led away the beautiful steeds
and they were taken to Diomedes&rsquo; tents.</p>
<p>Aphrodite now approached her fainting son and
her merciful arms bore him off the field. &ldquo;It must
be a goddess who has rescued him,&rdquo; said Diomedes
to himself. &ldquo;But it can be none other than Aphrodite,
who appears so unwarlike. Good, I will overtake
her and attain undying fame.&rdquo; He hastened
after the goddess, swung his spear, and wounded
her in the wrist, so that her clear blood stained the
earth. The goddess screamed and let the warrior
slip from her arms, but he was again rescued by
Ph&oelig;bus Apollo, who covered him with a dark cloud.</p>
<p>Diomedes still pursued the goddess with loud
cries. &ldquo;Retire, daughter of Jupiter, and leave the
battlefield to men. It is bad enough that thou
causest women to bring such misery upon the nations.
Woe to thee shouldst thou come near me in the
fight!&rdquo; The goddess was terrified and fled as fast
as she could. Iris came to meet her and conducted
her to the edge of the battlefield, where Mars, the
god of war, sat gloating over his work. A cloud
surrounded him and concealed him from mortal eyes.
&ldquo;Dear brother,&rdquo; said Aphrodite, &ldquo;lend me thy
horses that I may quickly reach Olympus. Look!
A mortal has wounded me.&rdquo; Iris took the reins
and the horses flew swiftly away through the air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>Meanwhile Diomedes was still on the field seeking
&AElig;neas, and not until he heard Apollo&rsquo;s threatening
voice, &ldquo;Take heed, son of Tydeus, and give way,
tremble and do not strive with the gods,&rdquo; did he
desist and remember Athena&rsquo;s warning. Apollo
carried Aphrodite&rsquo;s son to his sacred temple on
the heights of Pergamus. There he healed and
strengthened him, and the hero soon reappeared
among his followers, who were amazed at the miracle.
He at once plunged into the fight and slew many
brave youths among the Achaians.</p>
<p>Apollo had meanwhile complained to Mars of the
defeat of the Trojans and of Diomedes&rsquo; insolence in
daring to attack the gods. The god of war, who
inclined first to one side, then to the other, was
persuaded to take part in the battle himself, and
this time to support the Trojans. Concealed in a
cloud, he strode first before Hector, then before
another Trojan, and wherever he went the aim never
failed. Diomedes, however, had been endowed by
his friend Athena with the power to recognize the
gods when they appeared amongst men, so that he
was terrified, as he was about to throw himself upon
Hector, to see the war god striding before him.
He started back, and hastening toward the other
Greek warriors cried: &ldquo;Take care, friends, give
way and do not contend with the gods! For Hector
hath ever a god at his side. Mars is with him now
in the guise of a mortal.&rdquo; Diomedes, in awe of Mars,
retired from the field, although the battle still raged.
Hector slew two of the bravest Greek warriors and
captured their horses. Ajax of Salamis looked
grimly on, but did not dare attack him; he preferred
to pursue a weaker man, Amphius of P&aelig;sus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>The battle had begun almost under the walls of
Troy, but the Greeks had been forced back nearly
to the ships, and they began to lose courage. Juno
and Athena now determined to protect their favorites;
for had they not promised Menelaus to avenge his
wrongs? They signed Hebe to hitch the horses to
the splendid chariot. Athena donned her breastplate,
put on her golden helmet, and took up her
mighty lance and the shield called &aelig;gis. It was
decorated with golden tassels and in the midst was
the head of Medusa, the mere sight of which turned
men to stone. Thus armed, she mounted the shining
chariot, and Juno, standing beside her, guided the
steeds. The gates of heaven, guarded by the Hor&aelig;,
opened of themselves and the goddesses stormed the
heights of Olympus, where the father of the gods
was sitting in solitude looking down upon the confusion.
&ldquo;Art thou not angered, Father Jupiter,&rdquo;
spake Juno, &ldquo;that Mars is destroying the great and
noble Achaian people? Wilt thou object if I force
him from the field?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jupiter answered: &ldquo;To work! Set Pallas Athena
upon him. She will soon discomfit him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Overjoyed at the permission, Juno turned the
horses and in an instant they had descended to the
field before Troy. They paused where the Simois
flows into the Scamander and enveloped chariot and
steeds in a thick cloud. Then they hastened to the
side of Tydeus&rsquo; son, and in Stentor&rsquo;s shape and with
his brazen voice Juno cried out: &ldquo;Shame upon ye,
people of Argos, so glorious to look upon and so
faint-hearted. When Achilles was among you, the
Trojans scarce ventured from the gates, but now
that the only man among you is gone, they push
you back to the ships.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Athena approached Diomedes where he stood
beside his chariot, cooling the wound which Pandarus
had inflicted. He was just beginning to feel the
pain of it and could scarcely move his arm. He
loosened the leather straps and pressed out the blood.
&ldquo;Shame upon you, son of Tydeus,&rdquo; said the goddess
reproachfully. &ldquo;Thou art not as thy noble father.
He was more eager for the fray and slew countless
men of Cadmus&rsquo; race before Thebes. Thou knowest
that I never leave thy side. Speak, how can fear
have dominion over thee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goddess,&rdquo; answered the hero, &ldquo;for I recognize
thy voice, neither sloth nor fear restrain me, but I
remember thy command. I plunged into the thick
of the fight and piled corpse on corpse, until I saw
Mars, the terrible, who fights in the front ranks of
the Trojans. I gave way before him and warned
the others; for who shall fight against the gods?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>The goddess answered: &ldquo;Diomedes, beloved of
my soul, henceforth fear neither Mars nor any of the
immortals, for I am beside thee. Turn thy prancing
horses upon Mars and wound him boldly at close
range, the unstable one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She then took Sthenelus&rsquo; place in the chariot,
wearing the helm of Aides, which rendered her
invisible even to Mars. She guided the chariot
straight towards him. When Mars saw Diomedes
approaching he turned towards him, and leaning
over, was about to plunge his spear into his body,
but Athena turned it aside, and now Diomedes gave
him such a thrust in the side that a mortal would
certainly have succumbed. He withdrew the shaft
and Mars fled, howling like ten thousand men.
Both Achaians and Trojans were terrified at the din
and Diomedes was amazed at his own deed and saw
with astonishment the god rise up into the sky.
There he showed the painful wound to Jupiter and
complained loudly of Athena.</p>
<p>But the father of the gods answered grimly:
&ldquo;Spare me thy whining! I despise thee above all
the gods. Thou hast always loved quarrels and
bickerings and art as stubborn and contentious as
thy mother, Juno. But I cannot see my son suffer.&rdquo;
With these words he commanded P&aelig;on, the physician
of Olympus, to heal him. He placed a cooling
balm upon the wound and Mars was healed, for he
was immortal. Then Juno bathed him and clothed
him with soft garments. As soon as the murderous
Mars had been driven from the field the goddesses
returned to the dwellings of the Olympian gods.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">Chapter V</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Greeks are Successful&mdash;Hector Hastens to the City&mdash;Glaucus and Diomedes, Hector and Andromache</span></h2>
<p>The day was declining, but once more the
Achaians pressed forward with renewed
courage, knowing that Mars was no longer
on the field. The Trojans gave way before them,
and soon they were near enough to see again the
elders and the women upon the city walls. Hector
and &AElig;neas did their best to spur the soldiers to
resistance, but without avail. Then Helenus, one
of Priam&rsquo;s sons, who had the gift of prophecy, spake
unto Hector: &ldquo;Dear brother, do thou and &AElig;neas
try once more to encourage the people. Then go
and leave the battle to us. Hasten into the city.
Tell our mother quickly to summon the noble
women of the city to Athena&rsquo;s sacred temple and
there to lay her most costly garment in the lap of
the goddess. Furthermore she shall promise to
sacrifice twelve yearling calves upon Athena&rsquo;s altar,
if she will repulse that terrible warrior, Tydeus&rsquo; son.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>Hector carried out his brother&rsquo;s bidding and while
he was away the Achaians regained the supremacy.
Nestor went busily about admonishing them not to
waste any time in collecting booty, but only to kill,
kill, kill. Afterward, he said, there would be plenty
of time to strip the accoutrements from the slain.
Diomedes the insatiable, panting still for fresh
conquests, espied a man among the Trojans whom he
had never seen before, but who appeared by his rich
armor, his stature, and commanding mien to be one
of the leaders. When they had approached each
other within a spear&rsquo;s cast, they both reined in their
steeds and Diomedes cried out to the enemy: &ldquo;Who
art thou, excellent sir? I have not seen thee before,
although thou seemest to be a practised warrior.
Art thou some god? Then would I not contend with
thee, for such rashness hath ever brought misfortune
to a mortal. But if thou art a man like myself,
advance, that thou mayest quickly meet thy doom.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>It was Glaucus, Hippolochus&rsquo; son, who answered:
&ldquo;Oh son of Tydeus, dost thou ask who I am? The
children of men are like the leaves of the forest,
blown about by the winds and budding anew when
Spring approaches. One flourishes and another
fades. My race is a glorious one. It sprang from
the Argive land and my ancestors ruled the city of
Ephyra. Anolus was the founder of my family;
Sisyphus, his son, was that wise king whose son was
Glaucus; his son in turn the glorious Bellerophon,
endowed by the gods with superhuman beauty and
strength. Who has not heard of his heroic deeds?
He slew Chim&aelig;ra, the creature with a lion&rsquo;s head,
a dragon&rsquo;s tail, and body of a goat&mdash;a savage,
ravening monster. Next he conquered the king&rsquo;s
hostile neighbors, gaining every battle. The king
gave him his beautiful daughter and half of his kingdom.
His two sons were Isander and Hippolochus,
who is my father. He sent me hither to Troy and
admonished me to excel all others and never to
disgrace my ancestors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diomedes planted his spear in the sand, crying
joyfully: &ldquo;Then thou art my friend for old times&rsquo;
sake. My grandfather &OElig;neus entertained the glorious
Bellerophon in his house for twenty days, and
on his departure they exchanged gifts in token of
friendship. &OElig;neus&rsquo; gift was a purple girdle and
Bellerophon&rsquo;s a golden goblet, which I have in my
possession and often admire. Therefore thou shalt
be my guest in Argos and I thine, if I should ever
visit Lycia. So let us avoid each other in the battle.
There remain enough Trojans for me and enough
Achaians for thee to kill. But as a pledge of the
agreement let us exchange armor that it may be
seen that we are friends of old standing.&rdquo; They
descended from their chariots, shook hands cordially,
and took off their armor. Glaucus got the worst
of the bargain, for his breastplate and shield were of
gold, while those of Diomedes were only of brass.
However, he gave them up gladly. They then
renewed their vows of friendship and drove rapidly
away in opposite directions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>When Hector reached the Sc&aelig;an gate he was
surrounded by Trojan women inquiring for their
sons, brothers, and husbands, but he could not stay
to comfort them and hastened away to his father&rsquo;s
palace, where he sought out his venerable mother,
Hecuba. &ldquo;Dear son,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;why hast thou
deserted the battlefield to come hither? The cruel
Achaians are pressing us hard. But tarry until I
bring thee good wine, that thou mayest make an
offering to the gods and then refresh thyself; for
wine giveth strength to a weary man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so, mother,&rdquo; answered Hector. &ldquo;Befouled
as I am, how can I sacrifice to the gods? Not for
this did I come hither, but to bring thee a message
from Helenus.&rdquo; Then he repeated his brother&rsquo;s
instructions and Hecuba hastened to obey them.</p>
<p>Hector meanwhile made his way to the handsome
palace of Paris, where he found his brother turning
over and examining his weapons. Helen sat by the
fireside among her maidens, occupied with domestic
tasks. &ldquo;Strange man!&rdquo; said Hector. &ldquo;I cannot
understand thy conduct. The people are melting
away before the walls and this bloody battle is
chiefly on thine account. Thou wert always bitter
against the slothful and hast ever encouraged others
to fight. Come, let us go, before the city is fired by
the enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gladly will I follow thee, brother,&rdquo; answered
Paris. &ldquo;Thy reproaches are just. I have been
brooding upon my misfortune, but my wife has just
persuaded me to return to the field, and I am ready.
Tarry a while until I have put on my armor or else
go and I will follow thee.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Hector,&rdquo; spake gracious Helen sadly,
&ldquo;how it grieves me to see you all engaged in this
cruel war, for the sake of a contemptible woman
like myself. O that I had been destroyed at birth
or had been flung into the sea! Or, if the gods have
destined me to such misfortune, would at least that
I had fallen into the hands of a brave man, who
would take the disgrace and reproaches of his family
to heart and could wipe out his shame by heroic
deeds. But Paris is not a man. Enter and be
seated, Hector, for thou has toiled most arduously
in my behalf and suffered most for thy brother&rsquo;s
crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thy gracious invitation I may not accept,&rdquo;
answered Hector, &ldquo;for my heart urges me to return
to aid the Trojans. I beg thee persuade Paris to
overtake me before I leave the city. Now I must
go to my own house to see my wife once more and
little son; for who knoweth whether I shall ever
return?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not find his spouse at home, but on the
tower at the Sc&aelig;an gate, where she was following the
fate of the Trojans. As he neared the gate she came
to meet him, the modest, sensible Andromache,
and behind her came the nurse with the little boy.
His loving wife took him tenderly by the hand and
wept over him. &ldquo;Thy courage will surely be thy
death,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Take pity on thy miserable wife
and infant son, for the Achaians will surely kill thee,
and then I had best sink into the earth; for what
would remain for me? I am alone. Hector, thou
art father and mother and brother to me, my precious
husband. Take pity on me and remain in the
tower. Do not make me a widow and thy son an
orphan.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>Hector answered: &ldquo;Dearly beloved, I am troubled
also at thy fate, but I could not face the Trojan
people if I shunned danger like a coward. True, I
foresee the day when sacred Ilium will fall, bringing
disaster upon the king and all the people, and thy
fate touches me more nearly than that of father,
mother, or brothers. Thou mayest be carried away
to slavery in Argos to labor for a cruel mistress.
Rather would I be in the grave than see thee in
misery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sadly the hero stretched out his arms to his boy,
but the child hid his face in the nurse&rsquo;s bosom,
terrified at the helmet with its fluttering plumes.
Smiling, the father took it off and laid it on the
ground, and now the boy went to him willingly.
He kissed the child tenderly, and turning his eyes
heavenward prayed fervently; &ldquo;Jupiter and ye other
gods, grant that my boy may be a leader among the
Trojans like his father and powerful in Ilium, that
sometime it may be said: &lsquo;He is much greater than
his father.&rsquo; May his mother rejoice in him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>As he placed the child in its mother&rsquo;s arms, she
smiled through her tears. &ldquo;Poor wife,&rdquo; he said,
caressing her, &ldquo;do not grieve too much. I shall not
be sent to Hades unless it is my fate&mdash;no one can
escape his destiny, be he high or low. Do thou
attend to thine affairs at home and keep thy maidens
busily at work. Men are made for war, and I most
of all.&rdquo; He picked up his helmet and hurried away.
Andromache went also, but often turned to gaze
after her dear husband.</p>
<p>Paris overtook his brother at the gate. &ldquo;Do not
be angry, brother, at my tardiness,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My
good fellow,&rdquo; answered Hector, &ldquo;thou art a brave
warrior, but often indifferent. I cannot bear the
scornful gossip of the people who are enduring so
much for thy sake. But we will talk of this another
time&mdash;perhaps when we shall make a thankoffering
for the defeat of the Achaians.&rdquo; Thus speaking
they hastened towards the battlefield.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Hector and Ajax in Single Combat&mdash;A Truce&mdash;Another Battle at the Ships</span></h2>
<p>To the weary Trojans the appearance of the
two heroes was as welcome as a long-desired
breeze after a calm at sea to a
sailor, and they soon made their presence felt.
Pierced by Paris&rsquo; arrow, the excellent Menestheus
fell and Hector slew the valiant E&iuml;oneus. Many
another who had believed Hector far away met
death at his hands.</p>
<p>Then came his brother Helenus, the seer, and
bade him summon a warrior from among the Achaians
to come forth and fight with him in single combat.
The gods had revealed to him that the day of Hector&rsquo;s
doom was not yet come. Immediately the hero
ran to the front, and requesting a truce cried out:
&ldquo;Hear me, ye Trojans and Achaians! Jupiter hath
brought to naught our agreement, and our quarrel
has not been settled as we hoped. Let us now
arrange a second combat. Send your most valiant
warrior forth to fight with me. If he slay me, let
him take my costly armor, but my body he shall
send to Ilium, that my bones may be burned and
the ashes preserved. Should the gods grant that I
slay him, then I will hang his armor in the temple of
Ph&oelig;bus Apollo. But ye may raise a fitting monument
on the shore, so that when his grandchild sails
the Hellespont and passes the high promontory he
may say: &lsquo;That is the mighty monument to the
brave hero whom Hector slew in the final combat.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>For a while all was quiet in the Greek camp.
Each was waiting for the other to offer himself, for
it was a hazardous undertaking. At last Menelaus
arose, overcome by a rising feeling of shame, and
cried angrily to the other princes: &ldquo;Ha! ye who
can boast so well at home and on the battlefield are
women, where is your courage now? It would
indeed be our everlasting shame if none of the
Achaians dared match himself with Hector. Sit
still, ye cowards! I will gird myself for the fight.
The victory lies in the hands of the immortal gods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He began to put on his armor, but the other kings,
and even his brother, restrained him. &ldquo;Stay, my
brother,&rdquo; said Agamemnon; &ldquo;do not be in a hurry
to take up the challenge. Some other valiant
Achaian will doubtless come forward.&rdquo; Menelaus
reluctantly obeyed, and now old Nestor began to
reproach the faint-hearted warriors. &ldquo;Your hearts
have no courage and your bones no marrow,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;If I were like myself of old, when I slew
the hero Ereuthalion, Hector should soon find his
man.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>Abashed at Nestor&rsquo;s well-merited rebuke, nine
men arose and came forward. Agamemnon himself
was among them and the two Ajaxes; the others
were Diomedes, Ulysses, Idomeneus, and his charioteer
Meriones, Eurypylus, and Thoas. It was
proposed that they draw lots, and it fell to the elder
Ajax, who was proud of the honor that had come to
him. &ldquo;I trust that Jupiter will give me the victory,
for I am not unskilful and fear not the foeman; but
pray for me that Jupiter may give me success,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Ajax now rushed forward to meet the waiting
Hector. Truly he was no mean adversary, being a
man of powerful build. His armor was impenetrable
and it was this fact alone which now saved
him from certain death. His shield was composed
of seven layers of cowhide with an iron covering;
helmet and breastplate were equally strong. According
to the custom of the time, the combat did
not begin at once and in silence, but the warriors
first paused to taunt and revile each other.</p>
<p>Ajax cried out: &ldquo;Now thou canst see, Hector,
that there are still men among the Achaians who
are not afraid to accept thy challenge, even though
Achilles is not with us. I am but one of many.
Come, let us to work!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thinkest thou to anger me by thy defiance, son
of Telamon?&rdquo; answered Hector. &ldquo;Do not deceive
thyself. I know how to hurl the spear and turn
the shield so that no bolt can touch me. My deeds
bear witness to my words. Beware, valiant hero,
I shall not attack thee with craft, but openly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>At the same moment he hurled the great spear with
all his might, and it pierced six of the leathern layers
of Ajax&rsquo;s shield before its power was spent. Ajax
quickly aimed his own at Hector&rsquo;s breast. Hector&rsquo;s
shield was not strong enough to withstand the blow;
however, by a quick turn of his body, he prevented
the point from entering his flesh. Both men now
withdrew their spears from the shields and threw
themselves upon each other. But Hector&rsquo;s well-aimed
blow only blunted the point of his lance and
Ajax&rsquo;s spear slipped on the smooth surface of Hector&rsquo;s
shield, wounding him slightly in the neck. Then
Hector turned hastily to pick up a stone, which he
hurled with all his might at Ajax&rsquo;s head, but the
hero warded it off with his shield. Ajax then picked
up a much larger stone, which he threw, breaking
Hector&rsquo;s shield and wounding his knee. No doubt
Hector would have attacked him once more had
the Greeks themselves not interfered, sending forward
a herald who separated the heroes, saying:
&ldquo;Warriors, it is enough. Ye are good fighters and
beloved of Jupiter; that we have all seen. But
night is falling and the darkness bids us cease our
strife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, friend,&rdquo; said Ajax. &ldquo;Bid Hector
lay down his arms, for he began the fight. When
he is ready to stop, I also am willing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Hector said calmly: &ldquo;Ajax, thou hast borne
thyself manfully and some god hath lent thee strength
and skill. Let us now rest and renew the fight
another time, until death shall claim one of us. Go
thou to feast with thy people, while I return to
Priam&rsquo;s city. But before we part let us exchange
gifts that future generations may say, &lsquo;Behold, they
fought a bitter fight, then parted in friendship.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>Thereupon he presented Ajax with his finely-chased
sword with its graceful scabbard and Ajax gave him
his purple belt. Thus they parted, each side welcoming
his man with cries of triumphant joy.
Agamemnon entertained the chieftains in his tent
as usual and to-day he set the largest and choicest
pieces before Ajax. When the meal was ended
Nestor began: &ldquo;Listen to my advice, chieftains.
Let us pause to-morrow long enough to bury our
dead. We will burn the bodies that each may
gather the ashes of his friends to bear them home
to his people. But here we will erect a great monument
to mark the place where the brave warriors
have fallen. I have also another proposal to make.
What think ye if we should hastily construct a deep
moat and a bulwark with a great gateway around our
camp? Then we should be as safe in our tents as
in a walled city.&rdquo; The counsel of the old man was
received with universal approval and Agamemnon
determined to set to work at once.</p>
<p>The Trojan princes too were holding council to
decide what they should do to force the Achaians to
retire. Antenor, the wise, urged the return of Helen,
but none would consent, not even Priam and Hector,
to force Paris to give up his beloved wife. &ldquo;I will
gladly return the treasure which we took from
Menelaus,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and give him plentifully of
mine own, if that will propitiate the Achaians.
But never will I give up Helen.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;For the present let us be on our guard,&rdquo; answered
King Priam, &ldquo;and to-morrow let Id&aelig;us go down
and give Paris&rsquo; message to the Achaians and ask if
they are not inclined to an armistice, until we have
burned the dead and paid them funeral honors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Early the next morning Id&aelig;us went forth on his
errand. He entered Agamemnon&rsquo;s tent and delivered
his message. The Greeks welcomed the
proposal for a truce, but Paris&rsquo; offer was rejected
with disdain. &ldquo;Let no one take Paris&rsquo; property,&rdquo;
roared Diomedes. &ldquo;We no longer fight for Paris&rsquo;
wealth, nor even for Helen. Even though he should
send her back, Troy shall fall, and truly the end is
not far off!&rdquo; Agamemnon and the other chieftains
all signified their approval and the herald took the
message back to the city.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the greater part of the Achaians were
engaged in digging a moat and building a wall about
the camp. The outcome showed that this precaution
had not been unnecessary, for as soon as the
battle was renewed the Achaians began to lose
ground. Jupiter forbade the gods to take sides,
and driving the celestial steeds himself, he descended
from Olympus to Mount Ida, from whence he could
observe the battlefield. The slaughter had begun
early in the morning and already many Trojans had
fallen, and still more Achaians, for the Trojans
fought desperately.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>A little past noon a threatening storm gathered
on Mount Ida and the people recognized the presence
of the father of the gods, for he alone had power over
the flashing lightning. It was soon apparent whom
he favored, for suddenly a terrible thunderbolt with
blinding flashes struck the foremost ranks of the
Achaians, so that all were panic-stricken and none
dared remain on the field against the will of Jupiter.
All fled to the ships, pale with terror. Nestor was
about to follow, when an arrow from Paris&rsquo; bow laid
one of his horses low, and if Diomedes had not come
to his rescue, he would certainly have fallen a prey
to the pursuing Trojans. Filled with renewed
courage at the thunderbolts of Jove, which they
took for favorable omens, they were like dogs on
the track of the frightened flock. Hector called
loudly upon his people to attack the wall and gave
orders that firebrands be brought from the city to
fire the ships. But the Trojans were dubious about
attacking the Greeks within their fortifications.
They were not well prepared for such an undertaking.</p>
<p>The Greeks now stood behind the wall, huddled
close to the ships. The terrible thunderstorm had
passed over and the sun shone once more. Agamemnon
boarded a ship, where he might be seen
and heard by all. The warriors were silent while
he cried: &ldquo;Shame upon you, sons of Argos, who in
Lemnos boasted that ye would each fight one hundred
Trojans! Now ye flee like frightened deer before
a single man. Already Hector threatens to burn
the ships. No wonder! It is your cowardice which
makes him bold. Oh, father Jupiter, hast thou
ever cursed a king as thou hast me? And yet how
many fat cattle have I not offered up? On the way
hither I did not pass by a single one of thy sacred
temples where I did not stop to burn fat haunches
in thine honor. Thou hast doubtless determined
to destroy us here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>Full of pity, the father of gods and men looked
down upon him and made a sign that he would save
the Dan&aelig;ans. He sent an eagle bearing a young
deer in its beak, which it dropped as it flew high
above the Greek camp, so that it fell palpitating
before the altar of Jupiter on the ships. As soon as
the Greeks saw this favorable sign, they pressed
forward with fresh zeal into the Trojan lines. The
heroes were like ravening wolves. Teucer of Salamis,
who was skilful with the bow, remained beside his
brother Ajax, who covered him with his shield
whenever he was in danger. Every arrow hit its
mark. Agamemnon looked on with delight, and
clapping the youth on the shoulder, he cried: &ldquo;Well
done, my dear fellow! Thus shalt thou bring joy
and glory to thy father in his old age. If the gods
grant me the victory over Troy thy reward shall
not fail&mdash;whether it be a tripod, a pair of horses
and a chariot, or a beautiful slave girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon afterward Hector&rsquo;s chariot came galloping
up. Teucer quickly set an arrow to his bow and
aimed at the hero, but the missile went astray and
Hector did not see the youth. Teucer shot another
arrow, which pierced the charioteer&rsquo;s breast. Hector
sprang down, and just as Teucer was taking aim for
the third time, a rock from Hector&rsquo;s hand struck
his breast and he sank on his knees. Ajax covered
him with his shield until soldiers came up and carried
the wounded youth away to his tent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>Juno and Athena, gazing sadly at the unfortunate
outcome of the battle, ventured in their resentment
to disobey the command of the father of the gods
and go to the rescue of the hard-pressed Achaians.
But Jupiter espied them and sent the gold-winged
Iris to warn them to turn back or he would strike
them with a thunderbolt that would shatter their
chariot and teach them not to resist father and
husband. Pouting, they obeyed, and in a rage
arrived at Olympus and seated themselves in the
great hall. Soon afterwards the mountain trembled
at the tread of Jupiter, who entered the hall and
seated himself on his golden throne with dark looks
at his wife and daughter, whose glances were fixed
defiantly on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are ye so sad?&rdquo; he began mockingly. &ldquo;Ye
did not remain long on the battlefield, meseems.
Your lovely limbs trembled ere ever ye saw the
fray. Truly ye would never have returned to the
glorious home of the gods had my thunderbolt
struck you. My power is far beyond that of the
other gods. Even should they all come to measure
their strength against mine, and if I stood at heaven&rsquo;s
gate and let down a chain to earth and all Olympus
hung to the chain, ye could not pull me down. If
I but raised my hand ye would all fly up. Even
the earth and sea I would draw up, and if I should
wind the chain around the peaked top of Olympus,
the whole globe would dangle in space.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>Meanwhile night had fallen, which put a stop
to further strife. Hector retired to the middle of
the field and gave orders that the whole army should
remain in camp lighting watchfires everywhere, so
that the Greeks might not board their ships unseen
and steal away. The old men and boys were to
watch the city gates to guard against surprise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Agamemnon Advises Flight&mdash;Council of the Princes&mdash;A Deputation is Sent to Achilles</span></h2>
<p>Fear and unrest prevailed in the camp by the
ships, and even Agamemnon was no longer
confident. He quietly called the chieftains
to a council of war. &ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I perceive
that Jupiter is not inclined to fulfil the promise of
his omens and no longer desires that I take Troy
and lead ye home laden with booty. He has already
destroyed many of us and our misery grows greater
day by day. Surely he is but making sport of us.
Therefore let us launch our ships and return home,
saving at least those of us who are left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a while the princes were silent. Then Diomedes
sprang up and spake: &ldquo;Do not be angry,
O King, if I disagree with thee. It seems to me thou
art faint-hearted, for none of us has given up hope.
Truly the gods do not give everything to one man,
and Jupiter has made thee a powerful king; but
valor, the flower of manly virtues, he has denied
thee. If thou art so anxious to return, very good;
then go. The way is open and the ships are ready.
But the rest of us will remain until we have destroyed
Priam&rsquo;s fortress. And if all others should flee, I
would remain with my friend Sthenelus, for it is the
gods who have brought us hither.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>All the warriors applauded this, and when Nestor
had praised Diomedes&rsquo; words, there was no further
talk of retreat. The venerable man now counselled
that the walls should be carefully guarded and that
watchfires should be lighted everywhere. He signed
to Agamemnon to invite the friends into his tent,
offer them refreshment, learn each one&rsquo;s opinion,
and to follow the best.</p>
<p>Nestor was the first to speak. &ldquo;Great Atride,&rdquo;
he began, &ldquo;if thou wilt consider when it was the
gods began to compass our ruin, thou wilt admit
that our misfortunes began on the day when thou
didst unjustly insult and abuse, to our great sorrow,
that most valiant man whom even the immortals have
honored. We were all displeased and thou knowest
how I tried to dissuade thee. I think that even now
we had better seek to conciliate the angry man with
flattering words and gifts.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;Honored Nestor,&rdquo; answered Agamemnon, &ldquo;I will
not deny that I was in the wrong. It is true a single
man, if chosen by the gods, is equal in might to an
army. But having offended I will gladly make
amends and offer him every atonement. I will give
him rich gifts and he shall have, besides, the maiden
over whom we quarrelled. How glad I would have
been to return her as soon as my rage had cooled.
If Jupiter will but grant me the good fortune to
destroy Priam&rsquo;s mighty fortress, Achilles&rsquo; vessel
shall be heaped up with gold and silver and he may
select twenty Trojan women for himself, the fairest
after Helen. And when we return to Argos I will
refuse him none of my daughters, should he wish
to become my son-in-law, and will present him with
seven of my most populous cities as a wedding gift.
Thus will I honor him if he be willing to forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this Nestor answered: &ldquo;Son of Atreus, thou
dost offer princely gifts which might well propitiate
the proudest. Let us send messengers to him.
Let them be Ulysses and Ajax and the venerable
Ph&oelig;nix, whom his father Peleus sent hither as his
companion and friend. Let the heralds, Hodius
and Eurybates, accompany them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The encampment of the Myrmidons was on the
seashore and they found Achilles in his tent, apart
from the others, playing the harp and singing of
heroic deeds. His good friend and comrade, Patroclus,
sat opposite him listening. Ajax and Ulysses
entered first and Achilles immediately put down his
harp and came towards them. Patroclus also arose
to welcome his old comrades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye are heartily welcome, old friends,&rdquo; began
Achilles, &ldquo;for I am not angry with you. Sit on
these cushions and, Patroclus, bring a tankard and
mix the wine, for we have honored guests here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>After they had eaten and poured out a libation
to the gods, Ulysses took the goblet and drank to
Achilles with a hearty handclasp. &ldquo;Greeting to
thee, Pelide,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;It is not food and drink
we crave. But we are troubled that thou art not
on the battlefield. The Trojans have pushed forward
to the ships and nothing stops them. Jupiter
has sent fiery tokens to encourage them and the
invincible Hector is hard upon us with murder in
his eye. Already he has threatened to burn the
ships. Even at night he does not retire, but encamps
on the open field and the whole plain is
illumined by his campfires. No doubt he is now
eagerly awaiting daybreak to destroy us, for he
fears neither gods nor men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear what Agamemnon offers thee&mdash;gifts so
costly that they would suffice to make any man rich
and powerful. Ten pounds of gold will he give thee,
and seven new tripods, with twenty polished basins,
besides twelve magnificent horses and seven Lesbian
slave women accompanying Brise&iuml;s&rsquo; daughter. And
when we shall have conquered Priam&rsquo;s city, thou
shalt heap thy ship with gold and bronze and take
twenty of Troy&rsquo;s fairest women for thyself. And
when we return to blessed Argos thou shalt be his
son-in-law and he will honor thee as his own son.
But if thy hatred of Atreus&rsquo; son is so great that thou
canst not forgive him, then consider the dire need
of the Achaian people, who are ready to pay thee
honor like a god. Truly thou shalt earn great glory.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>Achilles answered him: &ldquo;Noble son of La&euml;rtes,
let me open my heart to thee frankly. Neither
Agamemnon nor any other Greek can move me to
fight again for this ungrateful people. The coward
and the hero enjoy equal reputation among you.
Why should I risk my life for others? As the swallow
feeds its young with the morsels which it denies
itself, thus I have spent my sweat and blood these
many days for the ungrateful Achaian people; have
watched through many a restless night, fought brave
men, burning their houses and stealing away their
women and children. I have destroyed twelve
populous cities in Troy by sea and eleven by land
and always delivered the spoils up to Agamemnon.
He remained quietly at the ships and took my
plunder gladly, keeping always the greater part for
himself. Although each chieftain received a princely
gift, he took mine from me&mdash;the lovely woman
who was dear to me as a spouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did we accompany him hither? Was it not
for the sake of beauteous Helen? Do we not love
our women even as he? Let him leave me in peace
and take counsel with thee, Ulysses, and with the
other chieftains. For Hector shall never again
meet me in battle. To-morrow I shall launch my
ships, make offerings to the gods, and if thou wilt
take notice, friend, thou shalt see my ships at dawn,
floating upon the Hellespont. If Neptune favors
me I may reach my native Phthia on the third day.
There I have riches enough, so that I shall not need
the gifts of the haughty king. No, should he offer
me twenty times as much, and even a city like unto
the Egyptian Thebes, which, it is said, has one
hundred gates out of each of which issue two hundred
men with horses and chariots in time of war, even
then he could not persuade me until he had atoned
for his insult.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let him find another husband, who is nobler
and more powerful than I, for his daughter. Should
I reach home safely, my father will choose me a
noble consort, for there are many beautiful Achaian
maidens who are not wanting in rich dowries. I
long for Phthia and already I foretaste the joys of
reigning over my father&rsquo;s good subjects and enjoying
a life of plentiful ease by the side of a gentle spouse.
Life is worth more than all Agamemnon&rsquo;s treasures,
and once lost can never be regained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dost know what fate my goddess mother hath
revealed to me? Either I die young upon the battlefield
and my name shall be imperishable upon earth,
or I shall live to a great age without renown. Let
it be as I have said, and if ye would have a word of
advice from me, it is this: &lsquo;Sail away before Hector
burns your ships, for ye will never conquer Troy.&rsquo;
Go, friends, and take this message to the Greeks.
But, Ph&oelig;nix, stay and return with me to our native
land, if so it pleaseth thee; for I would not compel
thee.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>They were all silent until the gray-haired Ph&oelig;nix
began to speak. &ldquo;If thou hast determined to return,
noble Achilles, how can I part from thee, my son,
for thy father confided thee to my care? Thy
splendid deeds have made me proud and happy;
but now, forgive me, godlike Achilles, now thy
obstinate and unreasonable behavior grieves me.
Calm thy rage. A gentle disposition well becomes
the hero, and even the anger of the gods can be
placated. How often have we seen them appeased
by sacrifices and penitential prayers. Yea, woe unto
him who listens not to repentant supplication and
who hardens his heart against the enemy who is
ready to make atonement. Behold what gifts
Agamemnon offers to win thee. What is the wrong
thou hast suffered in comparison with this great
honor? The ancient heroes of whom our fathers
tell certainly were subject to fits of anger, but they
also allowed themselves to be conciliated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ph&oelig;nix, honored sire,&rdquo; answered Achilles, &ldquo;do
not disturb my soul with lamentations; rather as
my friend shouldst thou hate him who hath wronged
me. But now repose thyself. As soon as dawn
appears we will take counsel whether to go or stay.&rdquo;
With a secret sign he bade Patroclus prepare a soft
couch for Ph&oelig;nix.</p>
<p>Hastily Ajax arose, saying: &ldquo;Let us be going,
for we can scarce expect to persuade this hard-hearted
man, and our friends are awaiting us anxiously.
Cruel man, to cause all thy friends to suffer for one.
How oft have anger and revenge for a murdered
brother been forgotten when the murderer has
offered gifts and tokens of repentance. But thou
hast a stony and implacable heart in thy bosom,
and all this on account of a girl. Oh be persuaded!
We have come here as thy old friends.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ajax, godlike son of Telamon,&rdquo; answered Achilles,
&ldquo;thou hast read my soul. But my heart is full of
bitterness when I think of the man who treated
me so vilely before the Argives. Go and bear him
the message. I will not take up arms until the
firebrands of the Trojans fall upon my own ships.
Terrible as he is, I think Hector will not venture
near my tents.&rdquo; Perceiving that their eloquence
was unavailing, the ambassadors returned to Agamemnon&rsquo;s
tent. Ph&oelig;nix, however, remained with Achilles.</p>
<p>The Greek princes were much cast down at the
answer to their mission. Only Diomedes was able
to keep up their courage by his unshakable confidence.
&ldquo;Atreus&rsquo; son,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;would thou hadst
never implored help of the Pelide or offered him rich
presents. He was proud enough before. Let him
go or come; he will take up his lance as soon as his
heart speaks. But do thou, King Agamemnon, as
soon as Eos&rsquo; rosy fingers paint the sky, array thine
horsemen and thy cohorts in front of the ships and
place thyself at the front. Let us now to rest, for
it is late and to-morrow we fight for our lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All agreed. The goblets were filled once more,
a libation poured out to the gods, and then they
separated, each one going to his own tent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Agamemnon in Battle&mdash;Many of the Greeks are Wounded</span></h2>
<p>Morning had scarcely dawned when Agamemnon
called all to arms, appearing in
the foremost ranks clad in his most splendid
armor and determined to fight more heroically
this day than ever before. The great mass of foot-soldiers
pressed forward in long lines shouting their
battle cries, the war chariots containing the leaders
following after them.</p>
<p>At last the two armies met and whole ranks of
men fell like grain before the reaper&rsquo;s scythe. For
some hours each side held its own, but toward noon
the Achaians broke through the enemy&rsquo;s lines and
forced them back. As soon as the ranks were broken
and bodies of men began to scatter in little groups
over the plain, the charioteers had room for action
and dashed forward to terrorize the foot-soldiers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>Agamemnon was among the foremost, hurling
his deadly lance continually at the Trojan princes.
Two young and beautiful sons of Priam, both in one
chariot, fell before him, and he took their accoutrements
and horses. Next two sons of Antimachus
came his way and received no quarter at his hands.
He stood with bloody arm uplifted, swinging his
lance, ready to strike down any who approached
him. The Trojans fled in multitudes at the sound
of his lionlike voice, and amid the wild confusion
one could see frightened horses, with empty chariots
trailing behind them, galloping back toward the city.
Agamemnon and the other chieftains were relentlessly
pursuing the flying Trojans, and as a lion following
a herd of cattle will fasten his cruel claws into the
necks of those which fall behind, thus the Achaians
struck down many a fleeing warrior.</p>
<p>It was now Hector&rsquo;s care to stop the rout and
bring order into the ranks once more at the city
gates. He implored, he admonished, he scolded
and threatened, and thus drove them back again
after a brief rest. Shamed by his words, the young
princes sought out the most dangerous antagonists
to show their valor. Iphidamas, son of Antenor,
was even anxious to contend with Agamemnon
himself, who, however, saw him coming and was
the first to cast his lance. But the youth dodged
the missile and ran quickly at him with his own spear
and would surely have run him through had the
brazen coat not bent the point of the weapon and
broken the force of the blow. Agamemnon seized
hold of the youth&rsquo;s lance with his powerful left hand
and forced both him and it down, while, with a
sudden blow of his sword, he cut off the youth&rsquo;s
head. A servant soon stripped him and carried off
the armor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>Koon, Antenor&rsquo;s second son, who had seen his
brother&rsquo;s fall, called some of his companions together
to avenge him. They approached Agamemnon
unobserved and Koon cast his spear, which struck
the hero&rsquo;s arm, wounding him so that the warm
blood spurted forth. The youth was triumphant,
for although Agamemnon did not fall, he saw him
stagger backward. He wished to make use of this
moment to carry off his brother&rsquo;s body, but as he
was bending over it, Agamemnon&rsquo;s spear entered
his side, and before he could recover himself Agamemnon
had sprung upon him and cut off his head.
The hero then turned away and attacked another
body of the enemy, slaying many. As long as the
warm blood continued to gush out he did not notice
his wound, but when it began to dry, he could no
longer endure the pain and was obliged to retire from
the field. He mounted his chariot, admonishing the
Achaians once more to fight bravely, and then drove
rapidly away to his tent to have his wound dressed.</p>
<p>His departure revived the sinking courage of the
Trojans. Hector pressed forward and the Achaians,
abandoned by their courageous leader, turned to
flee, as the Trojans had done before. The young
princes sought to measure their strength against
Hector, but only paid for their temerity with their
lives. Seeing this, Ulysses&rsquo; heart burned with rage.
He called Diomedes and said: &ldquo;Son of Tydeus, let
us fight together against that terrible man. It
would be a shame should plumed Hector take our
great ships from us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gladly will I tarry here,&rdquo; answered his friend
surlily; &ldquo;but much good will it do us, for Jove, the
Thunderer, does not intend the victory for us, but
for the Trojans.&rdquo; However, they set forth together
and plunged amongst the swarms of soldiers like
two raging lions, driving them backward, as waves
are whipped by the wind. Hector saw this from
afar and quick as a flash he bore down upon them in
his chariot, sprang to earth, and met the heroes on
foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; cried Diomedes to Ulysses when he saw
him; &ldquo;there cometh our destruction. But let us
stand firm, we will not flee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They stood awaiting him with their lances in
position, and at the moment when Hector emerged
from the crowd Diomedes&rsquo; spear struck his helmet
with such force that he was thrown stunned to the
ground. But the weapon had not wounded him,
for his iron helmet was not broken, and before
Diomedes had time to rush upon him with his sword,
Hector had jumped up and plunged back into the
crowd. Ulysses&rsquo; lance had missed the mark, and
before the two had recovered their weapons Hector
was safely on his chariot. Diomedes stamped his
foot with rage. He now set upon the enemy more
murderously than ever, and as he drove them back
and was nearing the tomb of the old Trojan King
Ilus, he was met by Paris, who stayed his mad
impetuosity. Hiding behind a pillar of the tomb,
he let fly one of his never-failing arrows, which
struck Diomedes, pinning his foot to the ground.
He saw the hero falter and stand still and sprang
from his hiding place crying in triumph: &ldquo;Ha! it
was a good shot. But how gladly would I have
pierced a vital part and taken thy life!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;Miserable coward!&rdquo; roared Diomedes. &ldquo;Hadst
thou met me in the open thy bow and arrow had
helped thee little. And now thou boastest as though
thou hadst conquered me, and it is but a scratch.
It is as though a mosquito had stung me. Woe
unto thee when I catch thee!&rdquo; However, the wound
was troublesome enough, for he could not stand on
his foot, and Paris would perhaps have ventured to
shoot a second arrow, if Ulysses had not come up in
the nick of time. He placed himself in front of his
friend and covered him with his shield, while Diomedes
sat on the ground and drew the arrow out of his
foot, which caused him sharp pain. He then called
for his charioteer and drove back to the ships, his
heart full of bitterness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>Ulysses remained behind alone, for his companions
had retreated in terror, and now he found himself
suddenly surrounded by the Trojans. He could not
escape and resolved to sell his life dearly with the
blood of his enemies. He met their attack like a
wild boar at bay, and so savage was his onslaught
that the enemy, surprised, stood still and none
dared come near him. But when he had stabbed
Charops, the noble son of Hippasus, his brother
Socus, full of grief and anger, stepped boldly forward
to avenge him, crying: &ldquo;Murderous Ulysses,
either thou shalt boast that thou hast slain both of
Hippasus&rsquo; sons or thou shalt die by my hand!&rdquo;
With this he threw himself upon Ulysses with his
spear and did actually pierce the shield and coat of
mail, tearing the flesh and causing him to start back.
But when Ulysses felt that the wound was not
mortal, he quickly hurled his own lance, crying:
&ldquo;Miserable man, thou too art destined to fall this
day by my hand!&rdquo; Socus shrieked aloud, for the
weapon had pierced clean through his breast.</p>
<p>On the other side of the battlefield the fighting
was equally fierce. Hector and Paris were busy
with spear and bow. Paris wounded the venerable
Machaon, a good soldier and much prized for his
surgical skill, for he had saved many lives. Therefore
his friends were anxious about him and Nestor
lifted him into his chariot and drove quickly away
with him to camp. There they dismounted to
refresh themselves in the cool breeze from the sea
and to dry their damp clothing. Then they entered
Nestor&rsquo;s tent, where he bound up his friend&rsquo;s wound
and gave him food. While they were eating Patroclus
entered the tent. Achilles had sent him to
inquire who the wounded man was whom he had
seen brought in by Nestor&rsquo;s chariot. For Achilles
was accustomed, when the Greeks were fighting, to
station himself on the high deck of his vessel to
watch the fray, not without regrets that he was
condemned to idleness; often his hand would grasp
his sword involuntarily. His joy over the overthrow
of the Achaians was the sweetest revenge he had for
his wounded pride.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, here is Patroclus,&rdquo; cried Nestor. &ldquo;Enter,
friend, and sit down with us. I have not seen thee
for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not press me, venerable sir,&rdquo; answered
Patroclus. &ldquo;I may not remain, for I must take the
tidings to Achilles for which he has sent me, and
now that I have seen Machaon I must away. Thou
well knowest how impatient he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Nestor continued: &ldquo;We thought that Achilles
was no longer interested in our fate. And hast
thou, his friend and companion, no influence with
him? Canst thou not win him with persuasive
words and tame his proud heart? That was what
thy good father expected.&rdquo; Patroclus was moved
by his words, and promising to do what he could,
took his leave.</p>
<p>Once more the Achaians were obliged to take
refuge behind the walls of the camp. Hector, followed
by the victorious Trojans, drove all before
him. When the greater part of the Achaians had
reached the shelter of the gate, Hector gave orders
that all the charioteers should leave their chariots
and lead their bands on foot across the moat, for he
was determined to climb or tear down the flimsy
walls. Hector was successful, although there was
a fearful struggle at the wall. The Achaians defended
their last stand with desperate courage,
while the Trojans were just as determined to accomplish
their purpose of driving the enemy from their
coasts and burning their ships that day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>Thus far Jupiter seemed to aid the Trojans, for a
terrible gale arose which blinded the eyes of the
Achaians with dust, though they still fought manfully
on and Hector was not able to accomplish his
purpose. Two Lycian youths, Sarpedon and Glaucus,
met outside the wall, resolved to shed glory
upon their people by their bravery and enterprise.
They sought to break down the wall at a spot defended
by Menestheus, and their first onslaught
was so savage that the Greek looked about him for
help. He sent a messenger to Ajax and Teucer to
come quickly to his aid, and they came running up
with spear and bow. Ajax threw a stone which
killed Sarpedon&rsquo;s attendant, who was already on
top of the wall. Next Glaucus climbed up, but
received Teucer&rsquo;s arrow in his arm, which incapacitated
him for further fighting. He got down very
quietly, so that the Achaians should not observe
his misfortune, pausing to cast one more spear,
which did its deadly work. Then he drove back
to the city.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>At last Sarpedon succeeded in making the first
breach in the top of the breastworks, and under
repeated blows the rest followed. This made the
wall so low at this place that the soldiers could
shoot over it, and here the hottest fighting now
took place. It was impossible to move Sarpedon
from his position. After a long struggle Hector
came up, saw the breach, and cried joyfully: &ldquo;Forward,
ye Trojan horsemen, break through the
Argives&rsquo; wall and cast burning brands into the
ships!&rdquo; He raised a mighty stone in both arms,
and although it was so heavy that two of the strongest
men could not have lifted it or even have loaded it
on a wagon with crowbars, Hector bore it as easily
as a shepherd might carry a bundle of shorn wool,
and with feet planted firmly wide apart, he hurled
it with such force against the gateway that the bolts
cracked, the hinges gave way, and the gate flew
wide open. He sprang triumphantly into the intrenchments,
followed by the shouting Trojans.
The frightened Achaians hurried away to defend
their ships. The cries and confusion were indescribable.
The Achaians were in despair. Nothing
remained for them but to save their ships, and
placing themselves in front of them in long rows
with lances set, they thus awaited the final onset
of the Trojans.</p>
<p>Each now forgot his own distress and all worked
together, and soon a solid chain of armed men surrounded
the ships like a wall. Hector himself, like
a mighty rock which falls from the mountain top
and plunges from ledge to ledge until it rests upon
the plain, could get no farther, but was obliged to
pause before the wall of lances. He tried to encourage
his men by promising them great rewards.
Now they believed that the last decisive moment
had come and that before night it would be seen
whether the gods had determined on the destruction
of the Achaians or of Troy. But Jupiter was but
favoring the Trojans in order to please Achilles and
his mother, Thetis. Fate had already decreed that
Troy was to fall, and even the gods could not change
this decision, for they too were subject to the laws of
iron necessity. As soon as Agamemnon had been
sufficiently punished and Achilles could be persuaded
to join the ranks of fighting Achaians, the
destruction of the mighty city was to be expected.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>As soon as the Achaians had intrenched themselves
they grew bolder and began a fearless attack.
Idomeneus charged the Trojans, followed by his
brave Cretans. As the hurricane raises dark clouds
of dust between the battle lines, thus the ironclad
cohorts moved hurriedly forward and threw themselves
on a party of the enemy. Idomeneus himself
sought an antagonist among the princes, and now
he chanced upon Othryoneus, who had just joined
the Trojans with his squadron and had a reputation
for great bravery. He had wooed Priam&rsquo;s most
beautiful daughter, not with the customary gifts,
but instead had promised his aid in driving the
Achaians out of Asia. Priam had given his word,
and the young hero was just beginning the struggle
for the lovely prize when Idomeneus&rsquo; spear put a
sudden end to his life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>The battle raged fiercest on the right side of the
camp where Hector was fighting. He was determined,
in spite of the heroes who opposed him, to
capture and burn the ships. All the fury of war
was displayed on this spot&mdash;rage, despair, revenge,
wild cries, fear, horror, and flight. The ground was
slippery with the blood of the fallen; there was now
no time to remove the corpses of the slain. The
Trojans were the first to lose courage. Even Hector
dared not keep his post where Ajax, Ulysses, and
Idomeneus stood together like a wall, but sought
out weaker adversaries and contented himself by
answering the challenge of the two Ajaxes with
insults and boasts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why dost thou seek to frighten the common
soldiers?&rdquo; called the elder Ajax to him. &ldquo;Drive us
back if thou canst! Thou wouldst gladly take our
ships, wouldst thou not? But I tell thee that thy
proud Troy shall sooner sink into ashes than our
fleet, and thou shalt sooner turn thy face homeward
in flight than triumph over us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment an eagle flew high over the heads
of the Achaians toward the right and, delighted
with the omen, they had confidence in Ajax&rsquo;s words.
But Hector answered him defiantly: &ldquo;Miserable
boaster, what foolishness is this! Would I were but
as certainly a son of Jupiter as that to-day will bring
destruction upon ye all. And woe to thee shouldst
thou stand before my spear! It would tear thy
delicate body and give thy blood to the dogs.&rdquo; He
then dashed away with his band to enter the battle
at another point. All were intimidated where he
appeared, and the battle cries of the Trojans surrounding
him rose high into the air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">Chapter IX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Agamemnon Consoled&mdash;The Gods Take Part in the Strife and the Trojans are Driven Back</span></h2>
<p>The Greek heroes who had been wounded on
the morning of this unlucky day and had
been obliged to retire from the fight had
remained in their tents in great discouragement,
caring for their wounds. Nestor still sat with
Machaon, and after he had tended him and given
him food and drink he arose restlessly and said to
his wounded friend: &ldquo;My dear fellow, let me go
and see what our fortunes are. The shouts of the
warriors seem louder at the wall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took a shield and lance and went out. Alas,
what a sight met his eyes! The wall was half
demolished, the gateway shattered, the Trojans
inside the intrenchments, and such wild confusion
prevailed that one could not tell friend from foe.
He sighed deeply and considered for a moment
whether he should go down into the turmoil or
seek Agamemnon in his tent. He chose the latter
course. But as he turned in the direction of the
kings&rsquo; ships, the wounded lords, Tydeus&rsquo; son Diomedes,
Ulysses, and Agamemnon, came toward him
with slow steps, leaning on their lances and sick
with wounds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nestor, Neleus&rsquo; son,&rdquo; cried Agamemnon, &ldquo;whence
comest thou and why didst thou leave the field?
Alas, I fear that all will come to pass as Hector has
threatened; that the Trojans will not rest until our
ships are burned and our people destroyed. The
Achaians hate and curse me as Achilles hates me,
for it is I who have led them into this misery. No
doubt they are now deserting or sitting brooding
beside the ships.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has been, even Jupiter cannot change,&rdquo;
answered Nestor. &ldquo;But let us consider what is
still to be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let me tell thee what I think,&rdquo; said Agamemnon.
&ldquo;As we are at the end of our resources,
my advice is that as soon as it is dark we launch our
ships and sail away while the Trojans are asleep.
Let them call us cowards! It is better to escape
thus than to be destroyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What words are these, O Atride,&rdquo; said Ulysses,
frowning. &ldquo;Thou shouldst have led an army of
deserters hither, instead of commanding men like
us, who have been taught from early youth to support
the hardships of war unto death. What? Dost
thou really intend to save thyself by stealing away
like a thief in the night? Hush! That no one else
may hear such unbecoming words!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>Agamemnon answered him: &ldquo;Ulysses, I feel thy
stern rebuke deeply, and I would not have the
Argives launch the ships against their will. If
anyone can give better counsel, let us hear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Diomedes began to speak. &ldquo;It is not far
to seek if thou wilt listen to me. I am indeed the
youngest here, but as well born as any, and I think
Jupiter hath given me courage and strength for
manly deeds. My advice, then, is that we return
to the battlefield, not to fight, for our wounds prevent
that, but in order to encourage the others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This speech pleased all and they followed him
straight to the place of combat. Just as they
arrived there they were met by Poseidon in the
figure of an elderly warrior, who grasped the right
hand of the ruler and said: &ldquo;Take courage, brave
Atride, the immortal gods will not be angry with
thee forever. Thou shalt surely see the day when
the Trojans will retreat in defeat to their city and
their heroes fall before our lance thrusts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words the old man returned to the
fight and with encouraging words spurred on the
hesitating soldiers to renewed effort. His voice
resounded over the battlefield like the shouting of a
thousand men and the Achaians obeyed it. The
princes gazed after him in astonishment, for his
kingly figure was unknown to them. They suspected
that it was a god come to encourage them.
Through hatred of the Trojans, Poseidon was
secretly aiding the Achaians contrary to the express
commands of Jupiter. But it would have gone hard
with him if the son of Cronos, who was looking
down on the battlefield from Mount Ida, had discovered
him at once. Juno contrived a scheme to
prevent this for a while at least. She went to
Aphrodite and said coaxingly: &ldquo;Wilt thou grant me
a favor, or refuse it because thou art resentful of
my aiding the Achaians, whilst thou art for the
Trojans?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>Aphrodite graciously answered: &ldquo;Mighty Juno,
speak. What dost thou desire? If I can grant it
I will do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Juno said cunningly: &ldquo;Give me thy magic
girdle of love and longing, which inclines the hearts
of gods and men to thee. I wish to visit old grandfather
Oceanus, who has quarrelled with his spouse
Thetis, and try if I may not reconcile them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could I refuse thee my help?&rdquo; answered
the goddess. &ldquo;Here, take it, and mayest thou be
successful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smiling happily, Juno took the magic girdle and
hastened to her chamber. She bathed her delicate
body, anointed it with ambrosial oil, and arranged
her hair in shining ringlets. She then put on the
fine long robe which Athena had woven for her,
closed it with golden clasps on her breast, and
wound the magic girdle about her waist. Beautiful
earrings, a shimmering veil, and golden sandals
completed the splendid dress. Juno now hastened
over the heights of Olympus and across the mountains
and streams of earth to Lemnos, where she found
Sleep, the brother of Death. He was indispensable
to her in carrying out the trick she had planned, so
she took him graciously by the hand and said:
&ldquo;Mighty Sleep, who tamest gods and men, if thou
wouldst ever do me a service, do it now and I shall
be forever grateful. My son Heph&aelig;stus shall fashion
thee an indestructible seat, whose cushions are
always soft, and it shall be shining with gold and
have a comfortable footstool for thy feet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>A smile like a ray of sunshine lit up the god&rsquo;s face.
Nothing could have tempted him more. Yawning
he asked: &ldquo;What dost thou want of me, honored
goddess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me and put the father of the gods to
sleep for a short time,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And to make
it easier for thee, I will beguile him with sweet
speeches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou askest a hard thing,&rdquo; answered Sleep.
&ldquo;Anyone else I would dare approach, even ever-flowing
old Oceanus; but Jupiter, the Terrible, I
cannot venture near unless he calls for me himself.
Only remember how he raged the time I deceived him
at thy behest, when thou didst pursue his dear son
Hercules with storms, with intent to imprison him
on the island of Kos. All Olympus trembled at his
wrath, and I should have been lost had Night not
protected me out of friendship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Juno replied: &ldquo;Dost thou suppose the father of
the gods cares as much for the Trojans as he did for
his dear son? No indeed! As thy reward I promise
thee for thy wife the fairest of the Graces, whom
thou hast so long desired.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then swear it,&rdquo; cried Sleep, overjoyed, &ldquo;that
I may trust thee, and I will do thy bidding instantly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The goddess touched the earth with one hand
and the sea with the other and swore by the River
Styx and by the gods of the underworld. Then
they both passed over the sea to Phrygia. Juno
went straight up Ida, while Sleep, in the form of
a nighthawk, slowly circled about the mountain
top and hid himself in the branches of a tall pine
tree.</p>
<p>When Jupiter saw his consort he was greatly
astonished. His dear wife had never appeared so
lovely to him before. She had Juno&rsquo;s eyes, but
Aphrodite&rsquo;s soulful glance; Juno&rsquo;s voice, but the
words seemed to come from the heart of the goddess
of love. The masterful, rebellious Juno, become
gentle, kind, tender, and modest, so surprised him
that he immediately forgot all his past grievances
against her and gave himself up to the sweet delusion
that this change would last forever. And now Juno
became so confiding and affectionate that her lord
forgot the Trojans and in looking at her his back was
turned to them, so that he could not see his disobedient
brother Poseidon. At last she made secret
signs to the bird lurking in the pine branches to
encompass the happy one with his outspread wings,
and he was soon peacefully at rest. Sleep then
flew quickly down to Poseidon to tell him that
Jupiter was slumbering and that it was now time to
aid the Achaians in earnest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>Then the sea god in the shape of an old warrior
went up and down the ranks preaching courage.
Under his leadership the people charged forward
like a hurricane beating against a forest. Many
men fell, most of them Trojans. Hector knew not
that a god was opposing him, so he did not give way
and still expected victory. But he soon met his
doom. He had just cast his lance in vain at Ajax,
and was about to pick up a stone, when Ajax quickly
hurled a great piece of rock, which struck the hero
under his shield and he fell back breathless. Shield
and stone dropped from his hands and he tumbled
over in the sand. Ajax and his friends were about
to come up and strip him, but at this moment the
bravest Trojan princes, &AElig;neas, Polydamas, Agenor,
and the valiant Lycians, Sarpedon and Glaucus,
surrounded him, all covering him with their shields
at once, until some of the servants lifted him on
their shoulders and carried him to his chariot.
When the chariot crossed the ford of the little River
Scamander or Xanthus, the friends lifted down the
moaning and still unconscious hero, laid him on the
ground, and sprinkled him with water. He revived,
opened his eyes, and wanted to arise, so they took
hold of his arms and lifted him to a kneeling position.
A stream of dark blood burst from his lips and he
sank into unconsciousness again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>The news of Hector&rsquo;s fall was greeted with loud
rejoicing in the Achaian army. Their old courage
returned and Poseidon&rsquo;s presence worked wonders
of heroism. The Trojans retreated farther and
farther and few of the leaders fought alone. Victory
now inclined toward the side of the Achaians, for
Hector lay wounded on the banks of the Xanthus
and the gods no longer fought for Troy. Thus the
Trojans soon found themselves again near the city
walls and even forced behind them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">Chapter X</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Jupiter&rsquo;s Message to Poseidon&mdash;The Battle for the Ships</span></h2>
<p>Jupiter awoke and rubbed his eyes. His
first glance sought the ships. How changed
was the situation! &ldquo;Ha, Juno,&rdquo; he cried
angrily, &ldquo;this is thy work, deceitful, malicious
woman! So that was the meaning of thy caresses,
thy friendliness and sweet talk, false serpent. Of
what use is it to chastise thee? Hast thou already
forgotten thy punishment when thou didst send a
storm to drive my son Hercules into imprisonment
on Kos and I made thee swing on a chain twixt
heaven and earth with an anvil fastened to each
foot? Suppose that now I were to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven and Earth are my witnesses, and I will
even swear it by the Styx, that Poseidon did not go
into the battle at my behest,&rdquo; said the affrighted
goddess. &ldquo;I do not know whether the Achaians
have persuaded him to it or his own heart. Rather
would I counsel him to go whithersoever thou
commandest.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>The father of gods and men answered, smiling
grimly: &ldquo;If thou wert of my mind, regal Juno,
Poseidon would certainly soon change his course.
But now call Iris quickly and Apollo of the bow, that
they may descend and command Poseidon to leave
the battlefield and return to his palace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lily-armed Juno willingly obeyed, though
she still meditated mischief in her heart. She drove
quickly to high Olympus, where she found the immortals
in the banquet hall. Craftily she spoke to
them. &ldquo;It is useless to seek to change Jupiter&rsquo;s
decrees,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Little he cares for us, for he
feels himself high above us all in strength and power.
Only just now I saw Ascalaphus, the beloved son
of mighty Mars, slain in battle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not blame me, ye dwellers in Olympus, if I
go to avenge the death of my son,&rdquo; wailed Mars;
&ldquo;even though the bolt of the Thunderer strike me
down.&rdquo; He rushed from the hall and donned his
shining armor, appearing greater and more terrible
than ever.</p>
<p>Incalculable mischief would have followed if
Athena, concerned for the rest of the gods, had not
hurried after him and taken his helmet, shield, and
lance from him by force. &ldquo;Imbecile,&rdquo; she cried,
&ldquo;wouldst thou destroy us all? Woe unto us if he
should see thee, the terrible Jupiter! Thy son was
but a mortal and other noble warriors have fallen;
it is impossible to save them all from death.&rdquo; With
these words she forced her angry brother back to the
throne and he obediently submitted to her warning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>Apollo and Iris flew quickly down to the green
summit of Ida, where Jupiter sat enveloped in dark
clouds. Iris he sent with a stern message to Poseidon
and his beloved son Apollo to Hector to strengthen
him with his divine breath. &ldquo;Then lead him into
the battle once more,&rdquo; said Jupiter, &ldquo;and aid him
thyself to drive the Achaians on board their ships.
Take the terrible &aelig;gis in thy hand and shake it,
that their hearts may quake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iris delivered her message to the sea god and he
answered it defiantly. &ldquo;Powerful as he is, I call
that tyrannical. To combat my will&mdash;mine, who
am his equal! For are not he and Pluto and I
brothers, and were not the upper and under worlds
divided equally between us? We cast lots; air fell
to him and water to me, but earth and sky are free
to us all, and he shall not stop me here. Let him
rule his consort and his sons and daughters. What
care I for his threats or commands!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Iris said doubtfully: &ldquo;What, dark-haired
World-power! Shall I take Jupiter thy answer in
just those words, or wilt thou not change thy mind?
It is well to keep the peace and respect is always
due the elder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iris, exquisite goddess,&rdquo; answered the angry
king, &ldquo;thou speakest sensibly and with reason, but
it was righteous anger overcame me, for no brother
should rule another. Now that I come to think it
over, I know I had best obey him. But tell him
this&mdash;that if, contrary to the wishes of all the
other gods, he protects Ilium&rsquo;s fortress and gives
not the victory to the Achaians, he may expect our
eternal enmity.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>He spoke, left the battlefield, and plunged into
the sea. Meanwhile Apollo had appeared to Hector,
saying: &ldquo;Be comforted, son of Priam, for Jupiter
sends me to save thee. I am Ph&oelig;bus Apollo, who
hath so often protected thee and thine. Follow me,
that we may scatter the Achaians.&rdquo; Thus the god
encouraged the shepherd of the people, and like a
colt which has broken its halter and gallops after
the other horses to the pasture, he hastened into
the battle turmoil. The reappearance of the hero
caused astonishment and consternation among the
enemy, and as the invisible Apollo shook the shield
of Jupiter, the mighty &aelig;gis, fear and horror took
complete possession of the people, and turning they
fled back to the ships. The battle raged fiercer
than before, and many brave men fell there.</p>
<p>Then Hector called aloud: &ldquo;The time has come,
brave Trojans, to board the ships. Let all keep
together. Let no one tarry to gather booty, and if
one remains behind, he shall die by my own hand.&rdquo;
He urged his horses across the moat, and the others
followed him with exultant cries. When they
reached the ships they paused and prayed aloud to
the gods for victory. A long roll of thunder presaged
good fortune, and with redoubled courage they
charged forward. Hector tried to board a vessel,
but in vain. The Achaians, from the deck, thrust
back everyone who made the attempt with their
long oars, and where Hector fought there were always
to be found gathered together the bravest warriors.
The Trojans, with their double-edged lances, fought
in their chariots, but the Achaians, from the high
decks of their dark vessels, used long, ironbound
oars.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>While the battle raged between the wall and the
ships Patroclus was sitting in Eurypylus&rsquo; tent
nursing his wounded friend. But he dared not
remain long, for fear of arousing Achilles&rsquo; anger.
He felt that he must see how his friends were faring,
and his heart urged him to persuade Achilles to come
to the rescue of the Achaians at last. He left the
tent and gazed with horror upon the dreadful battleground.
He saw Hector rush forward with a flaming
torch and try to fire a ship, but the Achaians turned
aside the fatal missile. Ajax of Salamis stood upon
the deck and thrust down with his lance all who bore
a burning brand. Hector aimed his javelin at him,
but it struck Lykophron, who stood beside him.
Ajax then called upon Teucer: &ldquo;Look, brother, our
friend has fallen by Hector&rsquo;s hand! Where is thy
avenging arrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Teucer hastily climbed up with his bow and with
the first arrow struck Klitus from his chariot. He
then selected a second and sharper arrow for Hector
and, as he was quite near to him, would doubtless
have pierced him had the cord of his bow not broken
just as he was in the act of drawing it. &ldquo;Woe is
me!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;A god brings all our attempts to
naught and must have broken this cord, a newly
twisted one, which I put on this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>Hector had seen the accident, accepted it as a
favorable omen, and cheered on his men. &ldquo;Let
everyone fight with all his might, for the Olympian
Jove is with us. And if ye fall it shall be a glorious
death for the women and children of Troy, and
surely the Trojans shall recompense ye as soon as
the Achaians are driven away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Where Hector rushed in, the troops huddled together
like a herd of sheep before a wolf. None
dared defend himself, but bowed his head in terror,
and trembling, received his deathblow with averted
face. The hero&rsquo;s fluttering plumes were like a lion&rsquo;s
mane and his eyes flashed fury under his dark brows.
Fear and shame kept the Achaians together. They
continually encouraged one another. Nestor particularly
besought the people to make one last
attempt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>Among the Achaian leaders the most notable
courage was shown by the Telamonian Ajax. He
ran from one ship to another to encourage the soldiers,
who could scarcely be forced to make another
stand. A Trojan brought Hector a torch, which he
threw into the foremost of the deserted ships. The
sight drove the Achaians to desperation. They all
rushed forward to defend the ship and a horrible
struggle took place. Battle axes, swords, and lances
hissed through the air and much blood flowed.
Hector clung to the ship and shouted: &ldquo;Bring up
the firebrands! Jupiter has given us the day and
we shall certainly take the ships.&rdquo; And &ldquo;fire! fire!&rdquo;
echoed through the entire army, so that all the
Achaians trembled. Ajax himself could make no
headway, but standing on one of the ships, he threw
lance after lance at everyone he saw approaching
with fire. His voice was never silent, but rose continually
above the din, calling to his people: &ldquo;Friends,
keep up your courage and show yourselves men! Is
there any help but in yourselves or is there another
wall behind you? Do ye know of other ships, if
these are burned, to carry you over the sea? Your
deliverance depends solely upon yourselves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fruitless zeal! The rattling spears of the enemy
drove them to flight more convincingly than the
voice of the lone leader to the attack. Their strength
was broken.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Patroclus Hastens into Battle and Scatters the Trojans&mdash;Hector and Patroclus</span></h2>
<p>Profoundly grieved at the sad fate of his
comrades, Patroclus turned from the bloody
spectacle and hurried to Achilles&rsquo; tent.
Hot tears were rolling down his cheeks as he entered.
Achilles, dismayed, forgot to rebuke him
and inquired with concern: &ldquo;Why dost thou weep,
Patroclus? Speak, tell me all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sighing deeply, Patroclus replied: &ldquo;Son of Peleus,
thou mighty hero of the Achaians, do not be angry
with me if I tell thee that the Achaians are suffering
too great misery. All over the field and at the ships
their bravest warriors have fallen, and but few of
the princes remain unharmed. Diomedes has been
shot through the foot and Agamemnon through the
arm; Ulysses is wounded in the side and Eurypylus
received an arrow in his thigh. The deserted
soldiers are panic-stricken and thou, obstinate one,
wilt not take pity on them. Cruel man! Thou
art so brave and yet thou wilt not raise thy hand
to save thy despairing friends. May a god never
be angry with me as thou art angry. Surely Peleus
is not thy father nor a goddess thy mother. The
dark sea depths or adamantine rocks must have
brought thee forth, so unfeeling is thy heart. Or is
it that thou obeyest some secret command of the
gods and darest not take part in the battle? Then,
at least, send me and give me thy Myrmidons that
I may perchance drive back the Trojans from the
ships. Lend me thy armor that the Trojans, deceived,
may retreat and the Achaian warriors take
fresh courage.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;No behest of the gods restrains me,&rdquo; replied
Achilles, &ldquo;nor is it my purpose to be angry forever.
As soon as the Trojans approach my tents and ships,
I shall gird on my sword and spear, and woe to him
whom I shall meet! But until then, let Agamemnon
bitterly repent his outrage and promise expiatory
sacrifices to all the gods. But I shall not allow the
Trojans the pleasure of destroying the ships. Therefore
go, as thou desirest. Lead the Myrmidons into
battle, for the danger is great. Diomedes no longer
shakes his mighty spear and I do not hear the
hated Agamemnon&rsquo;s valiant battle cry; instead,
Hector&rsquo;s lionlike voice penetrates my tent, with the
loud rejoicing of the Trojans. Take my resplendent
armor, but listen well to what I say. Thou mayest
drive the Trojans from the ships and back to the
intrenchments, but pursue them no farther. Take
care not to allow thyself to be enticed into an open
battle, nor still less dare to storm Troy&rsquo;s fortress
without me, for mine must be the glory, that the
Achaians may learn whom they have insulted.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>With these words he climbed to the upper deck
of his ship to reconnoitre. And how horrified he
was to see Protesilaus&rsquo; ship in flames, Hector still
advancing, and the Achaians giving way. &ldquo;Hurry,
hurry, Patroclus!&rdquo; he cried and smote his thigh
with impatience. &ldquo;The ships are already burning!
Put on the armor quickly, while I gather the Myrmidons.&rdquo;
There were more than two thousand of
them, splendid warriors of great strength and stature.
At their leader&rsquo;s call they assembled under arms.
Achilles divided them into five companies, to each
of which he gave a leader of proven courage and
experience. Meanwhile Patroclus bade Automedon
bring forth Achilles&rsquo; chariot and horses, with a
second one for emergencies. Then he put on the
shining armor, placed on his head the great helmet
with its crest of waving horsehair, and took two
lances, but not that of Achilles, for no other living
mortal could wield that.</p>
<p>Thus armed he sprang into the chariot beside
Automedon, who was waiting, whip in hand. Then
Achilles went to the chest which his mother had
given him, filled with cloths and warm garments,
and took out of it a precious golden goblet from
which he was accustomed to make sacrifice to the
greatest of the gods alone. He dipped it in the sea,
washed his hands, then filled the goblet with clear
wine, and with it in his hands went to the door of
his tent. &ldquo;Father Jupiter, ruler of the world,&rdquo; he
prayed, while he poured the first drops on the ground
in honor of the god, &ldquo;hear me now as thou didst
hear me when I was honored before the Achaians.
Grant that my friend may return to me covered
with glory, and fill his heart and the hearts of his
companions with courage, that they may make an
end of the Trojans at the ships, and that Hector
may learn that Patroclus knows how to order the
battle even if I am not with him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>The appearance of Patroclus and his followers
was like sunshine after a shower to the Achaians.
The Trojans were frightened, for they thought that
Achilles had come forth again, and even without
him the advent of two thousand fresh warriors was
matter enough for concern. When Achilles&rsquo; band
made a dash for Protesilaus&rsquo; burning ship, not a
Trojan stood his ground. The space about the ship
was cleared by the Myrmidons and they quenched
the fire which had already destroyed half of the ship.
But the battle was by no means at an end. The
leaders of the Trojans rallied their forces inside the
intrenchments and put them in order once more.
Patroclus did his friend credit; he was indefatigable
and himself slew many of the boldest warriors.
The other Achaian leaders joined him and new life
and hope filled every breast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>The Trojans could no longer maintain their position
inside the intrenchments. Hector was the
first to reach the open plain with his chariot, but
many another who tried to follow him was crushed
in the throng. But the rout would not have been
so general had Patroclus remembered Achilles&rsquo;
instructions. But his success, the suddenness of
the victory, and particularly his secret desire to kill
Hector, misled the zealous man to pursue the fleeing
enemy. He jumped from his chariot, which he
instructed to have follow him, and hurried after
his victims. Now he overthrew Pronous and took
his armor; next he slew the charioteer Thestor and
took his likewise. With a stone he crushed the
head of Euryalus, who was about to attack him,
and many others were struck down by his mighty
arm. Not a Trojan was able to withstand Patroclus.
The foolish man! Had he but remembered Achilles&rsquo;
warning he might have escaped death; but Jupiter&rsquo;s
decree is mightier than man.</p>
<p>A few hours earlier the Trojans had broken down
the enemy&rsquo;s wall and now the Achaians were seeking
to conquer the lofty walls of Troy&rsquo;s fortress, and
Patroclus himself was ambitious of being the first
to enter the city. But Hector plucked up courage
and commanded his charioteer to drive straight at
the leader. As soon as he saw him coming, Patroclus
left the wall and ran furiously to meet him, holding
his lance in his left hand and in the right a stone
which he had hastily picked up. This he threw
with all his might at the two tall men in the chariot,
and behold, it struck the good Kebriones, Priam&rsquo;s
son, and crushed his skull, so that his body fell
abruptly across the chariot seat. Patroclus cried
out maliciously: &ldquo;See how hasty the man is! There
are splendid divers among the Trojans. If he could
but have tried his luck in the water, instead of in
the sand, he would have caught plenty of oysters
to satisfy his hunger.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>He sprang upon the wounded man to take his
arms, but Hector jumped from his chariot and seized
his brother&rsquo;s head. Patroclus took his feet and the
two men struggled for the body. A crowd of Trojans
and Achaians came to their aid, and spears, shields,
and naked swords rattled noisily against one another.
The Trojans defended Hector as well as they could,
but while he struggled for the body, none could get
near him. However, a bold Trojan seized a favorable
opportunity, and with a powerful blow of his
sword, knocked off Patroclus&rsquo; helmet, cutting the
strap of his shield at the same time, so that it fell to
the earth. The hero started back and let go the
corpse, but as he turned, Euphorbus stabbed him in
the back. He tried to escape, but Hector laid him
low with his heavy lance. The Achaians trembled,
and even the most courageous of them lost their
heads, and none dared interfere as Hector, bracing
his foot against the body, drew out his spear, then
stripped off the armor. It was now Hector&rsquo;s turn
to mock at the dying man and he cried: &ldquo;Well,
Patroclus, dost thou still expect to lay waste our
city and carry off our women? One could see thou
hadst great deeds in mind. No doubt Achilles bade
thee not return without Hector&rsquo;s bloody coat of mail.
Now, poor man, thou liest here and givest me thy
fine armor, but thee I give to the dogs and birds of
prey for food.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>Faintly the dying man answered him: &ldquo;It is a
foolish boast, Hector. Thou camest, when I was
defenseless and wounded, to rob me. In open
conflict I could have slain twenty like thee, but a
boy could have done what thou hast done. But
vengeance is approaching and when it comes, think
of me. The godlike Achilles still lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spare me thy prophecies and die,&rdquo; replied Hector.
&ldquo;Who knoweth but Achilles, like thee, may give up
his soul at the point of my spear?&rdquo; With these
words he left the dying man and carried the splendid
armor to a place of safety, then went back into the
fray.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Fight for Patroclus&rsquo; Body&mdash;Achilles Mourns for His Fallen Friend&mdash;Thetis and Vulcan&mdash;Achilles&rsquo; Shield</span></h2>
<p>Hector next roved about seeking to capture
the splendid steeds of Achilles with which
Patroclus had entered the field, but he
could not come near them, for Patroclus&rsquo; charioteer,
Automedon, was already far distant. Meanwhile
the space about Patroclus&rsquo; body was deserted
except for Menelaus, who stood guard beside it,
covering it with his shield until some of his comrades
should come up to bear it away to the ships. He
was spied by Euphorbus, brother of that Hyperenor
who had fallen by Menelaus&rsquo; hand the day before.
He approached within a spear&rsquo;s cast and called to
him: &ldquo;Son of Atreus, stand back from the dead!
Thou shalt not give honorable burial to this destroyer
who hath slain so many of us. Back, before I rob
thee of thy sweet life!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>&ldquo;Great Jupiter,&rdquo; cried Menelaus, &ldquo;did one ever
hear such insolence! Only yesterday thy brother
Hyperenor was equally bold, but I believe he has
paid the penalty, for he can scarcely have returned
to his dear wife and old father on his own feet. The
same fate awaiteth thee, if thou approach nearer.
I advise thee to escape while thou canst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is for my brother&rsquo;s sake that I would fight with
thee,&rdquo; cried Euphorbus. &ldquo;How delighted shall my
father be when I bring him thy bloody armor in
token of vengeance. But why do I waste time in
talk? Let us try our skill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke he ran at Menelaus full tilt with his
lance, but the point bent like lead against the shield
and did not even scratch it. Then Menelaus ran
him through with his own spear and the slender
youth fell, as a tender sprout of olive is uprooted by
the wind. His long waving hair was bathed in blood
and he, who but a moment before had bounded
among the ranks of warriors like a deer, lay unrecognizable.
Menelaus was about to take his
armor when he saw Hector at a distance, and not
caring to face him he left Patroclus&rsquo; body and ran
to fetch the elder Ajax, that together they might
protect their friend from the thieving hands of the
Trojans.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>Then Glaucus spoke sullenly to Hector. &ldquo;Thou
art a great boaster, but never have I seen thee at
the post of danger, nor attempting to defend or
avenge any of thy comrades. The heroic Sarpedon,
who sacrificed so much for thee, was left to his fate,
and no one knoweth where he fell. Do the Lycians
deserve this at thy hands? If thou art so ungrateful
and no honor is paid a fallen hero, then mayest
thou fight thy battles alone and I will take my
Lycians home. If ye Trojans were men of courage
and decision, ye would carry off the body of Patroclus
to a place of safety. Doubtless the Achaians would
then offer the body of Sarpedon and his weapons in
exchange and even more. But thou fleest the battle
like a coward, fearing Ajax, who is, indeed, quite
another sort of man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Darkly Hector gazed at him and began: &ldquo;Ah,
my friend, I have always taken thee for a man of
sense, but now hast thou spoken rashly. When
did the enemy or the snorting of horses ever terrify
me? No, I fear neither Ajax nor Diomedes nor any
of the Achaian heroes, but rather the decree of Jove,
who has apparently given victory into the hands of
the enemy. What availeth the valor of a mortal
against the god of gods? But if thou wilt observe
my actions, take heed and see if I am as timid as
thou hast said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clad in Achilles&rsquo; magnificent armor he immediately
assembled his men with loud battle cries. Calling
all the princes together, he spoke to them. &ldquo;Friends
and allies, not to be in the midst of many men have
I called ye to Troy, but that ye might aid me in
time of danger to protect our wives and children.
It is for this that our poor people are laboring to
feed and sustain ye with their flocks and the fruits of
their fields, and for this I am striving with sword and
speech to encourage ye and spur ye on to the combat.
Then let us fight to the death! And to him
who bears the body of Patroclus into Troy I promise
a rich recompense.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>All followed him, shouting, to the spot where
Menelaus and Ajax stood shielding the body of
Patroclus. Their hearts beat wildly when they
saw the little band bearing down on them, and
Menelaus ran as fast as he could to procure more
help. &ldquo;Come friends,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;there lies Patroclus,
whom the Trojans would seize and carry away
to become food for Trojan dogs. Do ye not feel
the shame of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The younger Ajax was the first to hear and respond;
then came Idomeneus and Meriones, each with a
band of followers. They arrived beside the corpse
just as Hector and his men came up, and the shock
of meeting was like the ocean tide at the mouth of
some mighty river which empties into the sea, so
terrible was the crash of shields and lances.</p>
<p>Then Automedon with Achilles&rsquo; steeds came
dashing along, resolved himself to contend for the
corpse. Hector saw him coming and cried, rejoicing,
to &AElig;neas: &ldquo;There come Achilles&rsquo; splendid horses!
Come, if thou wilt aid me, let us take them!&rdquo; They
ran toward the chariot, but Automedon, springing
to the ground, called Ajax and Menelaus to his aid.
Chromeus and Aretus joined Hector and &AElig;neas
and a fresh contest raged about the chariot. Hector
aimed well and cast with mighty power, but Automedon
dashed quickly aside and the spear flew far over
him into the earth, where it quivered for a long time.
Automedon was more fortunate, and although
Hector dodged the blow, it struck Aretus, who stood
behind him. Meanwhile evening was descending
and Ajax was anxious to secure the body before
night came on. But it was all the Achaians could
do to hold back the enemy. Then Ajax said to
Menelaus: &ldquo;If only some good youth would hasten
to the ships and take to Achilles the tidings of his
friend&rsquo;s death perhaps he would come himself to
rescue the body from the enemy&rsquo;s hands. Dost
thou see Antilochus, Nestor&rsquo;s son? I think he could
reach camp quickest.&rdquo; Menelaus hastened away
to seek the youth, where he was fighting at the other
side of the battlefield. He was horrified to learn of
the hero&rsquo;s death and tears filled his eyes; but he
did not tarry and hurried away to Achilles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>Menelaus returned straightway to Ajax, saying:
&ldquo;I have sent him, but I doubt whether Achilles will
come without his armor. So let us try once more
to secure the body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou art right,&rdquo; answered Ajax. &ldquo;Let us make
another attempt, and if they retire but a little way,
do thou and Meriones seize the corpse while the
rest of us keep off the mighty Hector and the other
Trojans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This strategy partially succeeded and Menelaus
and Meriones were able to drag the body some
distance away. Meanwhile Achilles had been impatiently
awaiting his tardy friend. He ascended
to his usual post, the high deck of his ship, and saw,
approaching through the twilight and clouds of
dust, dense crowds which looked like fleeing men.
It seemed to him that he could hear Hector&rsquo;s triumphant
voice pursuing the Achaians. An uneasy
premonition seized him and he was about to send
out a messenger when young Antilochus appeared
before him and spake, weeping: &ldquo;Woe is me, son
of Peleus, I bring thee sad tidings. Patroclus
is slain, and our warriors are fighting desperately
for his naked body, for Hector has taken his
weapons.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>Achilles grew pale as death. He tore his hair
with rage, beat his breast, and threw himself upon
the ground, covering dress, face, and head with dust.
His eyes flashed dangerously, his heart palpitated,
and horrible groans escaped his half-open lips.
His slaves gathered about him in affright; but when
they learned the cause of his boundless sorrow, they
all burst out weeping. Antilochus wept also and
held the hero&rsquo;s hands, fearing that the passionate
man would harm himself. This terrible despair
lasted a long time, but at last the overburdened
heart found relief in tears and he broke out in loud
lamentations.</p>
<p>His mother Thetis heard him and arose from the
depths of the sea to seat herself beside her unhappy
son. She pressed his head to her bosom and inquired
tenderly: &ldquo;Dear child, what is troubling
thee now? Do not conceal anything from me.
Speak! Hath Jupiter not fulfilled thy wish and
given the victory to the Trojans?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>&ldquo;What care I for the favor of Jupiter when
Patroclus, whom I loved as myself, lies dead! Hector
hath slain him and taken the armor, that splendid
gift of my valiant father. For what a fate was I
born! But, indeed, I will not live if I may not slay
Hector and avenge the death of my friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glorious son,&rdquo; said his mother, weeping, &ldquo;when
thou hast slain him it will be thy doom; for thy
death is decreed immediately after Hector&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would that I were already dead,&rdquo; answered
Achilles gloomily, &ldquo;as I was not permitted to save
my friend. But I will avenge him and pay him
such honor as no mortal has ever received before.
Then let Jupiter do with me as he will. Death is
the lot of all. Even great Hercules died, the best
beloved of all Jupiter&rsquo;s sons. But before Death
takes me, many a Trojan woman shall lament that
I have slain her son or young spouse. They shall all
learn that my long rest is ended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not restrain thee,&rdquo; answered the silver-footed
Thetis, &ldquo;for thy grief is righteous and thy
resolution to honor the dead and save thy friends
from destruction is commendable. But thou hast
no weapons and I forbid thee to enter the turmoil
of Mars until at dawn thou seest me returning with
armor from the hand of the artist Vulcan.&rdquo; She
suddenly disappeared and ascended to Olympus to
beg the weapons from the god.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>THETIS CONSOLING ACHILLES</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>Meanwhile the noise of the struggle grew louder
as the fortunes of war drove the Achaians to flight.
With loud cries the Trojans followed the body of
Patroclus in the twilight, and although the two
bearers hurried as fast as they could to get it to a
place of safety, they were often in danger of losing
it. Hector pursued them continually with his men
and more than once had seized one of the dead
man&rsquo;s feet. The two Ajaxes had no thought of
killing Hector, for his gigantic stature appalled
them. They only held the corpse tighter, to keep
it from being torn from them. Just as they were
nearing the moat, they would have lost it, if a swift
messenger had not summoned Achilles. &ldquo;Help!
help! Achilles!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Hector will soon have
taken the body of Patroclus. He threatens to cut
off the head and put it on a pike and to throw the
trunk to the Trojan dogs. What a disgrace if thy
friend&rsquo;s body be taken and misused!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like a maniac, without armor or weapons, Achilles
rushed out, and in a voice like thunder rolling in the
mountains, he roared out most terrible threats, so
that both Trojans and Achaians were overcome by
fear and Hector, terrified, let go the corpse and
quickly retired with his followers, thinking Achilles
was already on his track. Thus the two heroes
brought the corpse safely into camp. Achilles
gazed long upon his friend, speechless, with bowed
head, clenched hands, and tears coursing down his
cheeks. The Trojans now held council whether
they should spend the night in the city or on the
battlefield. Polydamas was anxious to retire, for
he feared Achilles; but Hector insisted on remaining,
for he held that it would be cowardly to allow the
enemy to suspect that they were afraid. &ldquo;Let
Achilles come forth to-morrow,&rdquo; he concluded; &ldquo;he
will do so at his own risk. I shall surely not fly
before him. I long to meet him, and then Jupiter
shall decide which one of us shall be covered with
glory. Mars is a vacillating god, who oft destroys
the destroyer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>So they encamped on the field for the night.
Youths brought forth animals from the city for the
sacrifice, together with bread and wine, lit fires, and
prepared the evening meal. The Achaians also,
after supping, laid down to rest. But Achilles could
not sleep. Kneeling beside his dead friend, he laid
his hand on his cold breast and sobbed. Overcome
with grief he cried: &ldquo;Before the earth hides me,
thou shalt be avenged, my Patroclus. I will lay
Hector&rsquo;s weapons at thy feet and Hector&rsquo;s bloody
head beside them. I will slay twelve Trojan youths
in thine honor. Rest thou here in peace, for the
morrow shall shed glory upon thee and me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile Thetis had arrived in Olympus and
went straightway to Vulcan&rsquo;s dwelling. Late as it
was, she heard him hammering in his workshop,
for he was making twenty bronze tripods for the
Olympians&rsquo; hall. He had fastened golden wheels
to each foot, so that they could roll to the banquet
of themselves. They were all finished except for
the handles, and these he wished to complete that
night. Aphrodite, the beautiful spouse of the lame
fire god, was the first to spy the newcomer at the
door. She took her hand, saying: &ldquo;Welcome, dear
friend, what bringeth thee so late from thy sea
depths? Thou dost not often visit me.&rdquo; She led
her within and called her spouse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>He immediately left his anvil, washed his hands
with a sponge, also his sooty face, neck, and powerful
chest, threw on his cloak, and leaning on his
golden staff, came limping to the door. He took
the goddess&rsquo; hand and bade her welcome. &ldquo;I
always think of thee with gratitude,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;for
thou didst take me in when I was lamed and my
mother would not tolerate me in heaven. Then I
lived for a time in thy crystal palace under the sea
and fashioned many a pretty piece of work&mdash;rings
and clasps, pins and chains&mdash;until Juno took me
into favor again and I left thy dwelling. Therefore,
Aphrodite, see that thou entertain our guest
worthily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Thetis had partaken of the nectar and
ambrosia which Aphrodite set before her, she began
to recite all her son&rsquo;s troubles, from Agamemnon&rsquo;s
injustice down to the fall of Patroclus. Then she
begged the god to forge new armor for the unlucky
Achilles, so that he might be ready to attack Hector
in the morning. Aphrodite was displeased, for she
feared for the Trojans, but the god paid no attention
to her and promised to fulfil Thetis&rsquo; desire. He
immediately returned to his workshop and began
the work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>Before the night was two thirds past the most
splendid suit of armor that ever a hero had possessed
was completed. The shield especially was a work
of art. In the middle the earth was represented
with the sea and sky, sun, moon, and stars. There
were also two cities; one at peace and the other in
the throes of war. In one a wedding was being
celebrated with music and dance and there were
many pictures of peaceful labor in field and vineyard.
The other city was in a state of siege, and one
could plainly see the besiegers and the citizens defending
themselves. Around the edge of the shield
flowed the deep river Oceanus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Achilles and Agamemnon Reconciled&mdash;Achilles Goes into Battle</span></h2>
<p>Rosy-fingered Eos was mounting the
eastern sky as Thetis arrived at her son&rsquo;s
tent with the rich suit of armor. She found
him still stretched beside Patroclus&rsquo; body with the
mourning women about him. Achilles accepted
Vulcan&rsquo;s wonderful work joyfully, and the sight of the
weapons made his eyes flash with a dangerous light.
When he had carefully examined and admired the
artistic embellishments he said to Thetis: &ldquo;Mother,
these weapons are not the work of a mortal; some
god has forged them. Come, I will arm myself, that
the Trojans may tremble at the glorious sight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>He then approached the tents and ships of the
Achaians, calling to them loudly to come forth.
They rejoiced to hear the thunder of that voice,
which had been silent so long, and came hastening
to the council place. Diomedes was limping painfully
and leaning on his lance. Even Agamemnon
and Ulysses, both weakened by painful wounds,
came dragging themselves along with staves. When
they were all seated in their places, Achilles took
up the sceptre and spoke. &ldquo;Son of Atreus, let us
be reconciled, as we have long wished to be. I had
rather the gods had slain the rosy maiden before
ever a quarrel on her account had estranged us and
my anger sent so many noble Achaians down to
Hades. But let us forget the bitter past. I have
moderated my anger, for a generous man should
not be implacable, however much he has been
wronged. And now let us hasten to lead our people
to the combat, for the Trojans must not burn the
ships to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was interrupted by a loud shout of exultation.
The tidings that he had relented and would join
them in the battle was enough to fill all hearts with
joy. In their excitement they did not care to hear
more, and not until the thunderous tones of the
heralds had commanded silence could Agamemnon&rsquo;s
answer be heard. &ldquo;Jupiter alone knows,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;how blind rage could have led me to commit such
an injustice, from which my heart now recoils and
which I have long bitterly repented. Thou hast
already heard from Ulysses of the gifts which I
offered thee in reparation, and even now, that thou
comest of thyself, I will take nothing back. My
servants shall deliver all to thee, if thou wilt but save
the Achaians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smiling, the warlike Achilles answered him: &ldquo;I care
not whether thou givest or retainest thy treasure. Let
us think only of the war and lead the battalions without
delay against the enemy, for there is much work to
do and great deeds must be accomplished this day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>Now Ulysses spoke up. &ldquo;Not thus, excellent
Achilles; we must not be hasty. Let the soldiers
partake of food, for the battle will not be of a few
hours&rsquo; duration only. Thou hast more endurance
than all others, but none but thee can hold out
through the long day&rsquo;s work without food or drink.
Let the people first break their fast, while Agamemnon
sends for the promised gifts, that we may
all look upon them. Then he shall feast thee in
his tent, that thou mayest enjoy all the honor due
thee; for even a king should propitiate the man
whom he hath wronged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gladly follow thy wise counsel,&rdquo; answered
Agamemnon, &ldquo;and if thou wilt, thou mayest go
thyself to my ships, with six picked men, to fetch
the promised gifts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Son of Atreus,&rdquo; interrupted Achilles, &ldquo;never
mind the gifts. Let us think only of the slain, who
are calling to us to avenge them. And ye talk of
eating and drinking and of rest! If I were in command
the people should be led forth fasting and at
night; after the day&rsquo;s work they should feast twice
over. For my part, not a drop shall pass my lips
until I shall have avenged my friend. I have no
thoughts, but of murder, bloodshed, and the death
rattle of falling men.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>&ldquo;Great son of Peleus,&rdquo; suggested Ulysses, &ldquo;though
thou art no doubt stronger and braver than I, yet
I think I can give thee good counsel, for I have lived
longer and seen much. Take my advice this once.
Thou canst conquer only with warriors who are
rested, refreshed, and eager for the fight; but the
hungry and thirsty soldier will follow thee half-heartedly
and in the end be overcome by his own
weakness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without awaiting Achilles&rsquo; answer, the leaders
gave the soldiers the signal to break their fast.
Ulysses quickly selected six good comrades and
went to fetch the presents from Agamemnon&rsquo;s ships
and tents. He selected the basins, ewers, the horses
and women, weighed out ten pounds of gold, and
then summoned the fair Brise&iuml;s to follow him. On
their return to the council place Agamemnon sent
the gifts immediately to Achilles&rsquo; encampment.</p>
<p>In vain the noble Achaian heroes surrounded
Achilles and begged him to join them at the banquet.
He shook his head, saying: &ldquo;Kind friends, do not
trouble me, for I am very sorrowful and I shall fast
until the sun sets.&rdquo; The princes retired sadly to
their tents to partake of food. Only Atreus&rsquo; sons
and the noble Ulysses, Nestor, Idomeneus, and the
gigantic Ph&oelig;nix remained with him, trying to comfort
the mourner. He sat brooding over his sorrow.
&ldquo;Dear, unhappy friend,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how oft hast
thou brought me my breakfast and tended me while
the others went forth to battle, and now thou liest
here dead; but neither food nor drink can refresh
me while I mourn for thee. I had always hoped
that I alone should die in the Trojan land and that
thou shouldst return to Phthia, to bring up my son,
dear Neoptolemus. And now thou art gone before
me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>Thus he lamented, and all his friends mourned
with him. Even Jupiter was touched by his deep
sorrow and sent his daughter Athena down secretly
to strengthen his heart with heavenly nectar, and
thus the hero was able to appear in all his glory when
the warriors gathered together. The lust of battle
had dried the tears upon his eyelids.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XIV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Achilles in Battle&mdash;The Fight on the River</span></h2>
<p>All Olympus was now interested in the combat
of mortals since the godlike Achilles had
taken up arms again. Many of the divinities
promised him victory, but Jupiter was resolved
that he should not yet destroy the splendid city
of the Trojans, for fate had not decreed that it
should fall by his hand. Therefore he commanded
the other gods to stay the zeal of the Pelide should
he rage too terribly. The Trojans were already
armed and in the field and the swarms of Achaians
flew to meet them like a heap of dry leaves driven
before the wind. Achilles looked everywhere for
Hector, but without discovering him. Instead, he
espied two other chieftains, &AElig;neas and Lykaon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&AElig;neas determined to face the hero. He commended
his soul to his divine mother and pushed
forward shouting fierce threats. Achilles ran toward
him without hesitation and then stopping suddenly
he called out: &ldquo;How canst thou venture so far from
thy men, &AElig;neas? What is it impels thee to fight
with me? Dost think perchance that if thou shouldst
conquer me thou shalt become ruler of the Trojans?
Priam has still plenty of sons! Did I not meet thee
on Mount Ida, where father Jupiter himself was
scarce able to save thee? Thou didst run like a
deer, not daring to look behind thee. Thou hadst
better fly now, if life is dear to thee, and take care
not to get in my way a second time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Son of Peleus,&rdquo; answered &AElig;neas, &ldquo;do not hope
to frighten me with words like a child. My race is
as exalted as thine own, for I was fathered by
Anchises of Dardanus&rsquo; family and Aphrodite is my
mother. My family is old and powerful. But why
do we gossip like women? Come, let us see whether
it be Aphrodite or Thetis who shall mourn for her
son to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was the first to cast his spear, and Achilles
held his shield before him at arm&rsquo;s length, so that
should it pierce the metal, it might not touch his
body. But the swift-flying weapon glanced off
harmlessly. Immediately he hurled his own powerful
lance, but &AElig;neas threw himself on the ground
and covered himself. The mighty lance crashed
through the edge of his shield and buried itself in
the ground just behind the crouching man. He
arose quickly, seized a great stone, and threw it at
the head of Achilles, who was rushing upon him
with drawn sword in a blind rage, forgetting to
shield himself, so that had Vulcan&rsquo;s helmet not been
so strong, helmet and skull would doubtless have
been crushed. &AElig;neas was about to exult over his
fall, but Achilles only staggered back a step and a
god warned &AElig;neas to escape. He therefore drew
Achilles&rsquo; heavy spear from his shield, and throwing
it down, fled into the crowd of Trojans.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>When Achilles came to, he found himself on the
ground, supporting himself on one arm, and alone.
He was astonished and said to himself: &ldquo;What
miracle is this? Here lies my spear and my adversary
is nowhere to be seen. But indeed &AElig;neas must be
beloved of the gods, for no one has ever vanquished
me thus. But he did not venture to kill me in my
swoon and is, no doubt, happy to have himself
escaped. And now I must away to measure myself
with other Trojans.&rdquo; He first returned to his Myrmidons
and cheered them with loud cries of &ldquo;Forward,
man to man! Let none hold back! I cannot
alone conquer the whole Trojan army, even Mars
himself could not do that. But my lance shall
never rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among the Trojans the gallant Hector was going
about encouraging his bands. &ldquo;Do not fear, ye
valiant Trojans, because the enemy has gained a
single man to-day. Grim Achilles has certainly
uttered great threats, but words are not deeds.
Behold, I go forward to encounter him unafraid,
though his hand were a bolt of lightning and his
breast of bronze.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>Achilles had already broken into the ranks of the
Trojans and slain a man here and there. He was
like a hungry wolf hasting from one victim to another.
His lance was constantly in flight. He pierced the
noble Demoleon, then laid his charioteer Hippodamos
in the dust, then drawing his spear from the body,
he hurled it after Polydorus, Priam&rsquo;s youngest son,
whom his father had begged not to enter the fight.
But the youth, considered the best runner in the
army, was passionate and fiery and would not be
restrained. Just as he was flying past, Achilles&rsquo;
terrible spear struck him. He fell, groaning and
holding his wounded side. Thus his brother Hector
espied him and in a passion of grief he advanced
upon Achilles, swinging his lance like flashing
lightning.</p>
<p>Seeing him coming thus, Achilles cried: &ldquo;Ah!
there is he who killed my friend! Come, Hector,
come, that thou mayest meet thy doom!&rdquo; He had
scarcely spoken when Hector stood before him and
answered unabashed: &ldquo;Do not hope to intimidate
me with words, O Achilles! Even if thou art stronger
than I, it rests with the gods to decide whether I
shall not rob thee of thy life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He threw the lance with all his might, but it glanced
off Achilles&rsquo; hard-polished shield. He turned about,
frightened, and fled like the wind before the hero&rsquo;s
hissing spear. &ldquo;Ah! truly Ph&oelig;bus must be with
thee,&rdquo; cried Achilles. &ldquo;Destruction was hard upon
thee and thou hast escaped. But the next time I
meet thee I shall send thee down to Hades.&rdquo; He
glanced about angrily for other adversaries.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>See, now his chariot pursues a band of Trojans
who prefer to flee all together rather than meet this
single man. He pressed forward to one side, cutting
them off from the rest of the army and driving them
all into the river. There they paddled about like
swimming poodles until Achilles, leaving his lance
on the bank, sprang after them to stab those whom
he could reach with his sword. Finally he drove
twelve youths into the reeds and there bound their
hands behind their backs with his armor straps. He
then led them out and gave them into the hands of
his charioteer to take back to the Myrmidons.
They were destined for a cruel sacrifice to Patroclus.</p>
<p>Achilles turned again to the river and there he
recognized with astonishment, among those who
were trying in vain to clamber up the steep banks,
a youth, son of Priam, named Lykaon, whom he
had taken at the beginning of the war and sold for
one hundred oxen into Lemnos. Some years later
a rich Phrygian had purchased him, from whom he
had but lately escaped, having returned only eleven
days before to the house of his venerable father.
&ldquo;Ha! there is Lykaon!&rdquo; cried Achilles in surprise.
&ldquo;How comes he here? This time he shall taste the
tip of my spear and we shall see if he return from
the underworld to cause me trouble again.&rdquo; He
went to fetch his spear and Lykaon swam as hard
as he could to throw himself at his feet and beg for
mercy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; thundered the terrible voice of the hero,
&ldquo;what do I want with ransom money? Before
Patroclus fell I was inclined to show mercy and
carried away many captives, but now not one who
falls into my hands shall survive&mdash;least of all one
of Priam&rsquo;s sons. Die then, my friend! Thou criest
out in vain. Patroclus, too, had to die, who was
far mightier than thou. And seest thou not how
great and powerful I am? My father was a noble
king, a goddess is my mother, and yet my death and
doom are drawing near and sooner or later I shall
fall by the spear or arrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor youth&rsquo;s heart and knees trembled. He
spread out his arms, shut his eyes, and thus received
the death stroke. Then Achilles seized him by the
feet and flung him far out into the river. &ldquo;There!
Swim among the fish,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Many a one shall
feed on Lykaon. Thus I shall pursue ye all, until
ye have atoned for Patroclus&rsquo; death and the woe of
the Achaians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the river god who heard this blasphemy was
angered. Asterop&aelig;us, son of Pelegon, was still
standing in the water and Scamander breathed
courage into him. He was practised in casting with
both hands and Achilles saw him advancing with
two raised spears. He shouted to him: &ldquo;Who art
thou, rash man? Unhappy are the parents of those
who contend with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What wouldst thou know of me, great Pelide?&rdquo;
he answered. &ldquo;I came from distant P&aelig;onia with a
gallant army but eleven days ago. Now let us
fight, valiant Achilles.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>With these words he let fly both lances at once
upon the hero. One of them rebounded harmlessly
from the shield, the other brushed his left elbow
and buried itself in the sand. And now Achilles
swung his bloody staff, but missed aim also, and his
lance struck the sandy bank on the other side of the
river. Angrily he sprang into the water with drawn
sword, and striding powerfully through the waves,
he approached the unlucky Asterop&aelig;us, who was
trying in vain to secure Achilles&rsquo; lance. Before he
could do so the hero felled him, and he sank down
unconscious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he cried joyously, &ldquo;thou couldst scarcely
contend with a man of Jupiter&rsquo;s divine race, although
thy ancestor was a river god.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Achilles drew his spear out of the earth and left
the dying man gasping at the water&rsquo;s edge. He
threw himself next upon a troop of P&aelig;onians and
drove them into the stream. Those who would
not go of their own accord he thrust down into a
watery grave. Then from the depths of the stream
he heard the voice of the river god: &ldquo;O Achilles,
thou art superhuman in thy fury and the gods are
always with thee. But I warn thee, that if Jupiter
hath given the Trojans into thy hand this day,
murder where thou wilt, but do not pollute my
waters, for my stream is already glutted with the
dead, and even now I can scarce flow down into the
holy sea. Therefore forbear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Achilles heard the warning unmoved and replied:
&ldquo;It shall be as thou sayest, divine Scamander, but
I shall never stop destroying the Trojans until I
have fought the last decisive battle with Hector.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>But when he chanced upon a fresh troop of the
enemy, who were astray near the river, he forgot
the river god&rsquo;s decree, and when they all jumped
into the stream to gain the opposite shore he plunged
in after them. Then the invisible god arose in his
might, determined to destroy him. He sent wave
after wave breaking over him and drew him deeper
and deeper down. Struggle as he might he could
make no headway against the mighty stream on
whose waves he rose and fell, almost losing his
balance and being carried away. The bodies of
the slain bore against him and he could scarcely
hold them back with his shield. He struggled to
the shore, but the angry god stirred up a foaming
surf which threw him back again.</p>
<p>Almost exhausted he struggled forward once more
and grasped a young elm whose branches hung over
the stream; but just as he was about to swing himself
up by it the roots gave way, so that it lay across
the river like a bridge. Upon this the hero reached
the bank, although he vainly hoped to escape the
river god thus. Furiously Scamander followed him
across the fallow fields with breaking waves. He
also called to his aid the other streams who generally
dash their waters from the mountain heights to
destroy the farmer&rsquo;s fields only in springtime. To
the Simo&iuml;s, which joins him just before he flows
into the sea, he cried: &ldquo;Come, brother, and help me
stem the power of this terrible man, else he will batter
down the walls of Priam&rsquo;s fortress to-day; for none
can withstand him. Arise, friend, let thy floods
loose; roll down rocks and stones with thundering
waves upon him, that we may tame him. For I
ween that neither his strength nor beauty nor his
resplendent weapons shall save him. They shall be
buried deep in mud, and him will I cover with sand
and heap a monument of shells and pebbles over him
so high that none shall ever find his bones.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>The hero was almost overcome and in his despair
cried aloud: &ldquo;Father Jupiter, not a single one of
the gods will take pity on me, and I thought ye all
loved me! But none has deceived me more than
my divine mother, who promised me the glorious
death of a hero before Troy. And now, alas, an
ignoble end awaits me, and I shall be drowned as
ignominiously as any swineherd in a mud puddle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then from afar a solemn and consoling voice
arose. &ldquo;Be comforted, Peleus&rsquo; son, thou shalt not
die in the waters. Keep up the struggle until the
Trojans have fled the field. But when Hector is
vanquished thou shalt return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This promise filled his heart with courage, for it
was the voice of Poseidon, to whom all streams are
subject. And now the waters quickly subsided and
were drawn into the broad gulf of the sea. Then a
south wind arose which sucked up the moisture
from the ground and bore it away. The valiant
hero soon stood upon firm ground again and hurried
away as fast as he could to plunge into the fray.
Fired by his example, his people followed him like a
consuming flame fanned by the wind. All who could
do so fled to the walls, most of them toward the gate.
The venerable Priam sat upon the top of the wall,
looking mournfully down upon the sad plight of his
people. When the crush at the gate became intolerable
he descended and called to the guards:
&ldquo;Friends, open the doors and let the men in, for
they can no longer withstand the terrible Pelide.
When all are inside, shut the gate and put up the
bars, that the enemy may not enter also.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>In the confusion of flight, where none wished to
be lost, Achilles and his band would doubtless have
pushed in with them had not Apollo distracted
his attention by the sight of Agenor. This bold
youth stood concealed behind a beech tree turning
over a thousand projects in his anxious mind.
&ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;I am too
far behind to follow the others&mdash;he would take me
in the back like a coward. If I try to creep along
the wall and escape by way of the thickets of Ida,
the bushes may hide me; then I could steal up to the
gate at night and whisper to them softly to let
me in. But what if he should discover me there?
Then I should be lost indeed; for who is as strong
as he? But his body is not invulnerable and he is a
mortal like the others. Therefore I will try my skill
with him, that I may save my life with honor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile Achilles came running up and espied
the man hidden behind the tree. Agenor stepped
boldly forth and cried: &ldquo;Madman, dost thou hope
to destroy the fortress to-day? Nevermore! There
are still plenty of brave men in the city, and all are
fighting for parents, wives, and children. On the
contrary, thy own sad fate may be upon thee to-day,
thou ungovernable monster.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>With these words his flashing sword descended
upon Achilles, and not without effect. He struck his
shin, and only the impenetrable greaves fashioned by
Vulcan prevented the leg from being shattered.
Like a wounded boar Achilles pounced upon the
youth, who fled through wheatfields and thickets
along the river, leading his grim pursuer far away
from the city; for he did not give up the chase until
the youth was lost to sight. And this never would
have occurred had the blow on his leg not sapped
his strength. But Apollo had arranged it thus, so
that for this time the Trojans should escape; for
when he returned breathless he found them safe
behind their walls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Hector and Achilles&mdash;Hector&rsquo;s Death</span></h2>
<p>The Achaians, their shields slung over their
shoulders, were awaiting Achilles close
under the walls of Troy. All the Trojans
were within the city except Hector, who had remained
outside, resolved to meet Achilles once more in
combat; for he believed that he owed it to his
fatherland and to his own honor, either to free
his people from this dread enemy or to give up his
own life for them. His old father looked gloomily
down from the wall and signalled for him to come
inside, but in vain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>Achilles returned from his pursuit of Agenor, his
lance on his shoulder. At the sight old Priam beat
his breast in consternation and he trembled, seeing
his son without and alone. &ldquo;Dear son,&rdquo; he entreated,
&ldquo;do not face that cruel man, for he is stronger
than thou. Alas, would that the gods hated him
as I do and he would soon be food for the dogs! How
many of my sons he has already murdered or sold
to distant isles! And now, my Hector, thou on
whom the Trojan people put their hopes, wilt thou
also go to meet him? Come, take pity on me!
Already hath Jupiter heaped endless misfortunes
upon mine old age, and should he rob me of thee
now, I already foresee the enemy breaking into
our fortress, carrying off our women, murdering our
children, and plundering our treasures. Woe is me!
for I shall become food for mine own dogs in the
courtyard. Alas, that would be the most lamentable
of all destinies!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Hector could not be persuaded and remained
steadfast at the gate, awaiting Achilles. &ldquo;Woe is
me if I should hide now behind walls and gates!&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Then Polydamas could chide me with
reason for sacrificing so many good friends to-day.
I would not follow his advice and retire into the city,
but presumed to contend with Achilles alone, and
alas, I have not saved a single man from his fury
and, I openly avow, have myself avoided him in
fear, for he is truly terrible in his might. But now
I must challenge fate boldly, that the women of
Troy may not denounce me for leading the people
to destruction and then fleeing like a coward. But
how would it be if I should lay helmet and shield
on the ground beside my lance and thus go to meet
the hero and offer him a peaceful settlement? Offer
him Helen and all their treasure, together with half
of all the goods which the houses of the Trojan
princes contain? But no! I cannot approach him
a suppliant. It would be base and unworthy and
he would strike me down unarmed like a weak
woman. No! I will fight like a man. Be my fate
what it may, I will conquer or die with honor.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>Achilles came up looking like Mars himself. When
Hector saw him he trembled, and fled like a dove
pursued by a hawk. Hector turned first to the left,
then to the right, striving to tire out his pursuer;
but in vain. Now they ran past the watch tower,
now past the fig tree, and now by the hot springs,
where were the stone basins of the washerwomen.
His pursuer drove him clear round the great city,
yea, even three times round the walls, and as often
as Hector tried to slip through an open portal,
Achilles would drive him out again into the open
fields, keeping near the walls himself. But when
they passed the place where the Achaians were resting
on their spears awaiting the outcome, Achilles
forbade anyone to cast a spear at Hector and rob
him of the honor of the victory.</p>
<p>As they neared the hot springs for the fourth
time, a man ran forward as though to offer Hector
aid. It was Athena in the form of Hector&rsquo;s brother
De&iuml;phobus, who called to him: &ldquo;Brother, I saw thy
danger and am come forth to help thee. Stop and
await him boldly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beloved De&iuml;phobus, how didst thou dare&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My soul was wrung and I could no longer look
upon the grief of my father and mother.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>&ldquo;So be it, I will fight,&rdquo; said Hector, and made
ready to meet the foe. &ldquo;I will no longer flee before
thee, O Pelide,&rdquo; he cried to Achilles. &ldquo;My heart
bids me encounter thee, whether I conquer or fall.
But let us first make a compact and swear to it
before the all-seeing gods. Should Jupiter give me
the victory, I will not misuse thee. Thy armor will
I take and leave thy body to the Achaians, that they
may give it burial. And thou shalt do the same to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But with a furious look Achilles roared his answer.
&ldquo;No compacts, hated Hector! Does the lion make
a compact with the cattle, or the wolf with the
lambs? One of us must lie stretched upon the
ground, that Mars may be satiated with his blood.
I hope that thou mayest not escape me, and thus
atone at once for all the woe thou hast inflicted on
my people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus speaking, he sent his terrible spear flying
through the air. But Hector, quickly sinking on
one knee, avoided it and the iron missile passed over
him. Fresh courage filled him, and springing up
joyfully he cried: &ldquo;Wide of the mark, godlike
Achilles! Thou art a good talker and crafty, hoping
I should lose strength and courage. Now protect
thyself, for my spear shall not strike thee lightly!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>He hurled his lance with tremendous force and
did not miss the mark, for the point struck the boss of
the shield with a loud crash and would have pierced
both shield and breast had the shield not been forged
by Vulcan himself. But the lance rebounded like
a ball thrown against a wall and Hector stood confounded,
for he had but one spear. He quickly
looked about for De&iuml;phobus and called loudly for
another spear, but there was no answer and his
brother was nowhere to be seen. Then he was
filled with foreboding. &ldquo;Woe is me!&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;Some cunning god in De&iuml;phobus&rsquo; shape hath deceived
me, and now, when I hoped he would save
me, he has disappeared.&rdquo; In desperation he seized
his sword, rushing forward like a soaring eagle
swooping down upon its prey. But Achilles had
already picked up Hector&rsquo;s spear, and, as they
charged each other, the long spear reached its goal
sooner than the short sword. Taken in the neck
above his breastplate, the hope of Troy sank into
the dust, while the cruel victor and all the Achaians
loudly rejoiced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; cried Achilles as he drew forth his spear,
&ldquo;only yesterday thou wert so proudly triumphant,
as thou didst invade our ships in Patroclus&rsquo; stolen
harness, and to-day thou liest powerless before the
walls of thy proud fortress. Surely thou didst little
dream that the slain hero had left a powerful avenger.
We shall pay him all the honors of a hero, while thou
shalt make a shameful end among the dogs and
birds of prey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Breathing painfully, Hector tried to speak. &ldquo;I
conjure thee by thy life and by thy parents, let me
not be torn by Dam&aelig;an dogs, but accept the bronze
and valuable gold which my father and mother shall
offer thee. Send my body to Ilios, that the men
and women of Troy may pay me the last honors of
the funeral pyre.&rdquo; But Achilles shouted: &ldquo;Silence
and die, contemptible one!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>Dying, Hector answered: &ldquo;Indeed I knew I
should not move thee, for thou hast an iron heart.
But think of me when the gods avenge me and thou
sinkest into the dust felled by the shots of Ph&oelig;bus
Apollo.&rdquo; And Death, the brother of Sleep, bore
the hero&rsquo;s soul down to Hades. Many warriors
from the Greek army came up and looked with
admiration upon the splendid form of the hero.
And to one another they said: &ldquo;It is wonderful how
much gentler he is to look on now than there at our
ships when he was leading the assault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Achilles arose among the people and spoke.
&ldquo;Friends, now that the gods have permitted me to
subdue the man who has done us greater injury
than any other, let us discover whether the Trojans
will dare withstand us, without the support of their
great hero. But what am I saying? My friend lies
still unburied. Therefore let us chant the hymn of
victory and take Hector with us as an expiatory
offering for my friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>First the procession passed by the Sc&aelig;an gate,
that the Trojans standing there upon the walls
might see it. There sat old Priam and his spouse
Hecuba, without any warning of the outcome of
the combat. What a horrible sight for the venerable
father and loving mother! Their bravest son, the
pride and hope of Troy, dragged at the wheels of
the victor&rsquo;s chariot! All Troy set up a despairing
lament, as though the city were already in ruins
and a prey to devouring flames. His mother,
almost beside herself with grief, wrung her hands,
and shrieking, pulled the veil from her head and tore
her gray hair. And his father was scarcely to be
restrained from going down to cut his son loose or
die across his mutilated body. He called on those
by name who stood about it; begged, implored,
wept, and threw himself on the ground, strewing
dust on his gray head. And all those who saw it
wept with him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>Hector&rsquo;s faithful wife, Andromache, was the last
to learn the sad tidings, for she had been busy in
her home attending to household duties among her
women. And now, as twilight fell, she sent one of
her maids to heat water in a tripod for the hero&rsquo;s
bath when he should return. From a distance arose
a sound of loud lamentation and wailing of women.
The wife trembled and sad foreboding filled her
heart. &ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; she cried to two of the maids.
&ldquo;My knees are trembling, for I fear the noble Achilles
has cut off the valiant Hector from the city, for he
is always before all others and fears no one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>She rushed out, the servants following after her.
There was nobody to be seen in the street; the cries
came from the walls. The unhappy woman hastened
thither. One look revealed the tragedy, and she
sank down in a swoon. She lay for long as one
dead, and at length, when consciousness returned,
she began in a low, broken voice: &ldquo;Hector! Alas,
the unhappy people! Oh, that I had never been
born! Now must thou go down to Hades and I
remain here a widow, miserable and deserted.
And thy young son&mdash;trouble and sorrow menace
his future now that thou art gone&mdash;for others will
seek to take his patrimony&mdash;and his childhood
shall pass without a friend. For an orphaned child
has no playmates; and when the other boys take
their share of their fathers&rsquo; feast, none calls the
orphan boy to divide with him. The child casts
down his eyes ashamed and weeps silently. Then,
hungry, he goes about among his father&rsquo;s friends,
pulls one by the coat, another by the cloak; and if
one of them is kindly inclined, he will perhaps hold
the goblet to his lips. But, alas, he does not give
him his fill. The other boys, insolent and greedy,
do not suffer him at their feasts, but push him away,
crying: &lsquo;Thy father doth not sit at our feasts.&rsquo;
Then the child goes away and cries in his mother&rsquo;s
arms. O ye gods, my Astyanax! How gayly his
father used to rock him on his knees! And now,
robbed of a tender father, he shall suffer much&mdash;our
Astyanax, as the Trojans call him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus mourned Andromache, and round about her
wept and lamented the women of Troy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XVI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Priam and Achilles&mdash;Hector&rsquo;s Burial in Troy</span></h2>
<p>It was after sundown when the assembled
Achaians dispersed. Each returned to his
own ship or tent to partake of the evening
meal and then lay down to rest, well content. Only
Achilles could not sleep for thinking of his lost
friend. In vain he tossed to and fro on his bed;
sweet slumber came not nigh him. Thus he mourned
half the night, then suddenly arose, ran out into the
darkness, and wandered up and down the shore,
his heart full of sorrow. At last he went to Patroclus&rsquo;
grave, then hastened back to yoke his horses to the
chariot, to which he bound Hector&rsquo;s corpse once
more and dragged him thrice round the grave mound.
After this he drove the horses back to the enclosure
and threw himself again upon his couch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>Meanwhile the palace of old Priam had become a
house of mourning. The afflicted father had taken
no food nor drink since the death of his son, and
the wailing of the wife and mother had so touched
the people that they gathered about the house in
crowds. Even the gods looked down pitifully on
the unhappy family and Apollo appeared in dreams
to Priam to strengthen his heart and encourage him
to enter the Greek camp and plead for the body of
his son. Jupiter commanded Hermes to accompany
the old man, so that no enemy should hinder him or
do him an injury by the way. Overjoyed at the
divine vision, Priam forgot his complaints and went
at once to the chamber where stood the chests in
which he kept his treasures. He said to Hecuba,
his mourning spouse: &ldquo;I go to conciliate our terrible
enemy with presents, and the god who has given me
courage will protect me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the queen burst out weeping, saying reproachfully:
&ldquo;Unhappy man! Hast thou lost thy
senses? How canst thou go alone to the ships and
meet the man who has slain so many of thy valiant
sons! Truly thy heart is made of iron! Ah! if he
set eyes upon thee and seize thee, that false and
terrible man will have neither mercy nor respect
nor reverence for thine age. Oh, do not go! Let
us mourn at a distance our lost son, whom the fates
at his birth decreed should be vanquished far from
his people. Remain with us, dear one, that thou
mayest preserve thine own life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the old man answered confidently: &ldquo;I should
not go if it were only a priest or seer who sent me,
but I saw a god in my dream. He will not deceive
me and my own heart impels me to go. Dost thou
say the monster would kill me? Oh let him do so,
if only he will strike me down upon the breast of
my dear son!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>He opened the chest and took out the rich garments
which he intended to take with him for a
ransom&mdash;twelve splendid festal robes, twelve warm
covers, and as many tunics and magnificent cloaks.
Then from another chest he took ten talents of gold,
four polished basins, and two tripods. Even the
exquisite goblet presented by the Thracians when
he visited them as ambassador from his father he
did not withhold. For he did not begrudge giving
even his greatest treasure to soften the hard heart
of Achilles and ransom his beloved son.</p>
<p>When he had closed the box and turned around,
he found himself surrounded by a crowd of idle
people, who had come up to stare at the treasures
which were to be offered for Hector&rsquo;s ransom.
Angrily he cried out: &ldquo;Out with you! Away, ye
idlers! Have ye not trouble enough at home, that
ye come to look upon my sorrow? Only think what
ye have lost in Hector! Without his support the
Achaians will have an easier victory. Then it will
be your turn to lament, but I shall doubtless then
be dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drove them out of the courtyard, then called
for his sons, reproving them. &ldquo;Where are ye?
Not one is at hand when I need ye! My best sons
are dead, only the good-for-nothings remain. Pack
these gifts quickly in the hampers, and when it
grows dark, harness the horses and summon my old,
experienced Id&aelig;us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>Abashed, the sons obeyed all these commands
and Hecuba began to prepare a strengthening
draught for the travellers. Carrying a golden
goblet in her right hand, she came out to the chariot,
and placing herself in front of the steeds, she said
to her husband: &ldquo;Here, beloved, take this and pour
out a libation to Jupiter and petition him for a safe
return, as thou goest against my wishes. For I
should never let thee go if I could prevent it. And
even now I would counsel thee to consult the god
and learn whether it is his will to protect thee.
Should this prayer remain unanswered then I would
say, Remain. For woe to him who goes into danger
without divine support!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The worthy man answered her: &ldquo;I will obey thy
behest. It is always well to lift up our hands to
Jupiter.&rdquo; He spake and called upon the stewardess
for water, which she brought in a silver dish, sprinkling
him with her right hand, while with the left she
held a basin beneath. After this he received the
wine cup from his spouse, poured out the first drops
in honor of Jupiter, and prayed aloud with eyes raised
to the sky: &ldquo;Father Jupiter, almighty ruler, let me
approach Achilles as a friend and find favor before
him. Grant me a sign that thou wilt protect me,
so that I may set out confident and comforted.&rdquo;
His wish was fulfilled, for soon afterward one of the
eagles which nest high up in the clefts of Mount
Ida flew past on his right hand. All who saw this
rejoiced and the king and his companion mounted
the chariot, full of confidence. His sons accompanied
him to the city gates and, weeping, wished
him luck.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>Now the swift messenger of the gods descended
from Olympus to the shores of the Hellespont and
wandered along the road which Priam was to take.
He had assumed the form of a Greek youth of noble
race, whose appearance inspired confidence. Priam
had arrived at the grave of Ilus, where the Scamander
flows gently along, and there he had stopped to
water his horses. Old Id&aelig;us saw the godlike youth
coming along the river bank in the twilight and said
fearfully to the king: &ldquo;Look! son of Dardanus, there
cometh a strange man. He will surely kill us both
and make off with our goods. What shall we do?
Shall we fly to the city or shall we get down and
embrace his knees, begging for mercy?&rdquo; Priam
looked up and saw with dismay that the man was
already close to the chariot. Sudden fear paralyzed
his limbs, but when he saw the youth&rsquo;s face close by
and heard his friendly voice he was reassured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Greeting to thee, old man.&rdquo; Thus the youth
addressed him. &ldquo;Whither goest thou so late when
all other mortals are asleep? Dost thou not fear
the Achaians, who are not far away? And neither
thou, nor the old man thy companion, are fit to
defend yourselves. But I will not harm thee, for
thou art so like my dear father, noble king, that I
am drawn to thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fortune favors me,&rdquo; cried the old man. &ldquo;Now
I see that Jupiter is with me, as he hath sent me
such a noble guide through the dark night, of such
remarkable stature and strength and of such wisdom.
Truly thou hast fortunate parents.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, old man,&rdquo; continued the stranger,
&ldquo;where art thou taking these goods? Art trying
to carry thy greatest treasures to a place of safety
before the destruction of Troy, or art thou flying
secretly from the city for fear of the victorious enemy?
For indeed thou hast lost thy chief treasure. As
long as noble Hector lived, ye could battle on equal
terms with the Achaians.&rdquo; This warmed the old
father&rsquo;s heart. &ldquo;Who art thou,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;who
speakest so kindly of my poor son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who does not so?&rdquo; answered the stranger.
&ldquo;How often I have seen him in the stress of battle
driving the Argives in droves before him. We often
stood and admired him from a distance when Achilles
forbade us to join in the battle; for I am one of his
companions and came hither in the same ship with
him. My father is a noble Myrmidon called Polyctor.
He has property and money, but is an old man like
thyself. I am the youngest of seven brothers.
When Achilles went to war we cast lots to see which
should go with him, and the lot fell to me. I have
been wandering about, thinking of the fate of Troy,
for to-morrow the Achaians intend to assault the
city. They are weary of the long truce and are
anxious to end the war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If thou art one of Achilles&rsquo; companions,&rdquo; said
Priam, &ldquo;thou canst doubtless tell me whether my
son&rsquo;s body is still lying at the ships or whether the
cruel man has already thrown it to the dogs.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>The stranger replied: &ldquo;Not yet have dogs or
birds of prey touched it, although it has lain there
for twelve days and Achilles drags it round the
grave of his friend every morning. Neither has
decomposition touched it, and the beautiful limbs
are still preserved in remarkable freshness. Seeing
him, one would suppose he had but just died. Thus
the gods watch over him even in death, for they
always loved him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How happy the old man was at this news. &ldquo;Oh
child,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;how good it is for a man to pay
honor to the gods with due offerings. My son never
forgot that. He never failed to make sacrifice before
he partook of food himself, and now in death he is
receiving his reward. Oh what a happy father I
am! Here, friend, take this handsome cup in
remembrance of Priam. It was intended for Achilles,
for I am going to him to ransom my Hector. But I
have enough other gifts for him. Take it and guide
me to his tent. Thou knowest the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wilt thou tempt me, old man?&rdquo; answered the
stranger. &ldquo;I will not yield to it. I cannot take a
gift from thee without Achilles&rsquo; knowledge and rob
him of it. No, I am too much in awe of him. Some
harm might befall me. But I will accompany thee,
notwithstanding, and no plunderer shall come nigh
thee unpunished.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>With these words he swung himself on to the
chariot and placed himself between the two old
men, taking the whip and reins from the herald.
The horses trotted along boldly and confidently
through the fields and soon brought the travellers
to the walls of the camp. From a distance they
saw the servants busied with the remains of the
evening meal, but the god waved his staff and they
all sank into a deep slumber. Then he unbarred
the gates, drove inside and in the direction of the
enclosure in which the tents and ships of the Myrmidons
stood. There he took leave of Priam and
disappeared; but before he went he pointed out
Achilles&rsquo; tent and encouraged the trembling old
man. &ldquo;Go boldly in,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and embrace his
knees. The sight of thee will certainly move him,
for his soul is filled with melancholy. Adjure him
by his father and by his divine mother, whom he
loves tenderly. Thou wilt certainly touch his heart
if thou speak of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much comforted the king got down, leaving the
chariots and the presents outside in the care of his
old companion. His heart beat faster as he crossed
the threshold of the tent, but after a moment of
indecision he entered. He found Achilles still sitting
at the table where he had supped. Beside him
stood his two favorite companions, the excellent
driver Automedon and the skilful spearsman Alkimos.
The great hero was leaning on his elbows, sunk deep in
moody thought, and was not aware of the entrance of
the old man until he had fallen at his feet, clasped his
knees, and kissed his hands&mdash;those horrible hands
which had murdered so many of his sons. Achilles
was amazed, for he had been taken completely by surprise.
For a moment they gazed into each other&rsquo;s
faces, Achilles puzzled and agitated, Priam imploring
and anxious. At length a flood of tears relieved the
oppressed heart of the venerable man and in a trembling
voice he uttered these beseeching words:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>&ldquo;Remember thy father, godlike Achilles, who
languishes at home, old and helpless like myself.
Ah, perhaps his neighbors are even now oppressing
him and there is none to protect him. But he knows
that he has a good and faithful son, even though far
away, who will make an end of all his troubles when
he returns. The old man is full of hope and every
day he cherishes sweet thoughts of thee. But woe
is me! I was the happiest of fathers. I had raised
fifty sons, nineteen of them born of one mother.
They were my pride and joy. Then ye came to
invest my city and the unhappy war took one of
them after the other until but few were left. But
among them all, the best one still remained&mdash;he
who had protected me and all of us thus far; but
now he also is no more. Alas, I can no longer beg
for his life, but we long to see the dead once more
and pay him the honors due my son. At home
sisters, wife, and mother mourn for him, and see,
here lies his unhappy father at thy feet. Give him
back to me. I have brought thee rich gifts. Fear
the gods! Bethink thee and imagine thy old father
kneeling thus to a younger man. But I suffer as no
mortal ere has done before me and press my lips to
the hand which slew my children.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>The heart of the invincible hero could not withstand
these words and tears. He was deeply moved.
The picture of his own gray-haired father rose before
him and a sad longing for his embrace filled his heart.
He wept aloud and bent gently down to raise the
old man up, but Priam still clasped his knees tightly.
Thus they both sobbed, each conscious of his own
fate through the sorrow of the other. At last, when
they had wept for some time, Achilles spoke. &ldquo;In
truth, unhappy man, thou hast been much afflicted.
And yet thou hast dared to come alone and by night
to the Achaian ships and to the man who has slain
thy bravest sons. Thy heart is certainly strong and
courageous. But come, forget thy sorrow and let
me see no more of thy tears. Arise and sit here
and let us calm ourselves. The gods have decreed
that miserable mankind should live in sorrow, while
they know naught of trouble. For many they have
mixed the sad lots with the happy ones, but some
receive only ill fortune, so that his whole life is a
miserable failure and he is favored neither by gods
nor men. Alas! neither is my father fortunate.
Although the gods have bestowed worldly goods and
power upon him, and although a goddess became
his spouse, it is ordained that there shall be no heir
to his kingdom; for alas! he shall never look upon
me again, though his heart longs for me. I am not
fated to return home a peaceful ruler, to enjoy a
happy old age. Thus has fate robbed thee, also,
of thy good son. But he is dead; therefore lament
no more. Thou canst not bring him back to life.
Who can do aught against the all-powerful gods?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bid me not sit,&rdquo; sobbed the old man. &ldquo;I
will lie here until thou hast given me back my
only beloved son, that my tears may fall upon
him. But take the gifts and enjoy them in peace
when thou returnest to thy native land, because
thou sendest me away filled with gratitude and
love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words Achilles frowned and said: &ldquo;Do
not agitate me further, old man! Arise, for I have
already determined to give thee back thy son.
Do not insult me with fears and mistrust!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silently the old man obeyed this earnest behest
and rising seated himself. Meanwhile the hero,
mighty as a lion, arose and went out, followed by
his two friends. Before the tent they unyoked the
horses and conducted the herald inside. They then
took the valuable gifts out of the hamper, except
two soft garments, in which they were to wrap the
body of Hector. Then, unseen by the father,
Achilles caused two female slaves to wash the body
and to cleanse, arrange, and anoint the hair. Next
the servants wrapped the body in the fine robes and
Achilles himself lifted it onto the chariot and laid
it on a bier prepared for it. Then he stood still a
moment and said: &ldquo;Do not be angry with me,
Patroclus, if thou shouldst learn, perchance, in
Hades&rsquo; dwelling, that I have returned Hector&rsquo;s
body to his unhappy father. Look, he brings me
a not unworthy ransom and a share of it shall be
consecrated to thee.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>He re&euml;ntered the tent and seated himself opposite
his two guests. &ldquo;Now thou canst rest content, old
man,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Thy son is ransomed and lies on
thy chariot wrapped in fine garments. Now let us
partake of food and comfort our hearts. Even
Niobe did not forget to eat, although her heart was
torn by bitter sorrow when Artemis had slain her
six blooming daughters in one day and Apollo her
six splendid sons. So let us feast. Thou canst
mourn for thy son at home, for he is doubtless worthy
of thy tears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words Achilles got up quickly, fetched
a sheep and killed it. His companions cut up the
meat and roasted it carefully on spits. Then they
sat down at table, Automedon passed bread in a
basket, but Achilles himself served the meat, and
they all ate and drank their fill. The old man
admired and wondered at the splendid proportions
of the great hero, his godlike mien, and his bold and
fiery glance. But Achilles too was amazed at heart
when he noted the awe-inspiring, majestic demeanor
and the dignified countenance of the king and heard
his words of wisdom. When they had finished
eating, Priam said: &ldquo;Now, godlike host, take me
to a place, I beg thee, where we may refresh ourselves
with slumber; for I have not closed my eyes
since my son sank down among the dead, and this
is the first food and drink that have passed my lips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Achilles commanded his comrades to prepare a
couch for Priam and his companion in the porch.
The maids brought soft cushions and warm blankets,
arranged them all, and lighted the strangers out with
their torches. Achilles accompanied the king to
the door and pressed his hand at parting. A few
hours&rsquo; sleep sufficed for the old man. Then he arose
to awaken Achilles, for he was anxious to start before
daybreak.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>&ldquo;Restless old man,&rdquo; said Achilles kindly, &ldquo;depart
then. But first tell me something. How soon dost
thou intend to bury thy son? For until then I
will keep the peace and restrain my people from
battle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Achilles,&rdquo; answered the old man, much moved,
&ldquo;if thou wilt grant us this favor, give us nine days
to mourn the dead and prepare for his burial. On
the tenth day we will burn him, on the eleventh
erect the grave mound, and on the twelfth, if it must
be, we will resume the war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let this, too, be as thou desirest,&rdquo; replied Achilles.
&ldquo;I will hold the army in check for as long as thou
hast demanded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He clasped the old man&rsquo;s wrist to assure him of
good faith, then accompanied the chariot as far as
the gate in the wall, taking care that none of the
Achaians should harm the old man. Priam drove
once more through the well-known fields, past the
ford of the flowing Scamander, where yesterday the
friendly youth had appeared. And now, just as he
was watering his horses there, the sun rose. Cassandra,
Priam&rsquo;s favorite daughter, who had been standing
on the watch tower since dawn awaiting the
return of her father with beating heart, recognized
the travellers. She waited until she could discern
all plainly, even the covered body of her brother on
the chariot. Then she ran down the stairs to the
palace, calling her mother and sisters loudly. &ldquo;Only
look, they are coming! Hasten, Trojans, to look
upon the body of Hector, if ye have ever rejoiced
over him alive as he returned from the battlefield.
For he was the pride of the city and of all the people!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>All who heard her voice hurried forth, men and
women, all hearts filled with boundless sorrow.
But first of all came the old mother and Andromache.
They went out to meet the chariot and stopped it
at the city gate with loud cries. Mother and wife
threw themselves on the body and wet it with their
tears, tore their hair, touched his head, and lifted
up the cloths to look upon his wounds. The crowd
gathered, weeping, about them. But the king cried:
&ldquo;Stand back and let the horses pass! Ye may weep
your fill when I have carried him into the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all stood aside and the king entered the city,
the crowd following him to the palace. When the
corpse was lifted from the chariot the universal
lament began afresh. Singers were brought to chant
the hymn of mourning and round about the women
sobbed, especially Andromache, the beautiful princess.
She held the dead man&rsquo;s head in her hands
and moaned: &ldquo;Beloved, thou hast lost thy life, but
the widow, alas, is left behind and thy young son.
How shall he grow to manhood? For before that
Troy will fall, as thou art dead, who didst defend
the walls, the women, and lisping children. Soon
they will be carried away to bondage, myself among
them. And thou, my dear son, wilt go hence to
endure ignominy with thy mother, if indeed some
cruel Achaian entering the conquered city does not
seize thee by thy tender neck and hurl thee down
from the tiles into the streets below. Thy valiant
father hath slain many Achaians; therefore the
people mourn. O Hector, what unspeakable sorrow
thou hast caused thy parents, but I am unhappy
above all others! Dying, thou couldst not give me
thy hand nor speak words of wisdom which I might
have cherished.&rdquo; Thus she spake, weeping, fathomless
sorrow in her heart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>The old mother also could not be torn from her
beloved son. First she caressed his head, then the
cold hands, as though she hoped to call him back to
life. Helen too lamented over the dead. &ldquo;Hector
dearest,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;thou didst love me more than
any of my husband&rsquo;s brothers. What insults I have
suffered since the hero brought me to Troy! Thou
alone hadst never an unkind word for me. Yea
often, when thy mother or one of my sisters-in-law
or even their husbands heaped abuse upon me, thou
didst mollify the angry ones and make peace. How
thy friendly encouragement comforted me! Ah, I
shall never hear that dear voice again, and I have no
longer a friend in this house, where all turn from me
with loathing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus she lamented, and all the women mourned
with her. But the venerable Priam now raised his
commanding voice and spake. &ldquo;Ye Trojans, fetch
wood into the city and go without fear that the
Dan&aelig;ans are lying in wait for you. For Peleus&rsquo; son
promised with a sacred vow not to raise his hand
against us until the twelfth day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>Quickly they yoked oxen and horses to the carts,
and on the tenth day, when golden Eos arose, the
people all assembled for the funeral obsequies of
Hector. With loud lamentations they carried out
the corpse and laid it on the high scaffolding, which
they set on fire. When the pyre had burnt itself
out, they quenched the gleaming embers with red
wine. His brothers and the comrades of the hero
gathered together the white bones out of the ashes
and deposited them in a golden urn, which was
placed in the grave and gigantic blocks of stone
heaped upon it. The grave mound was raised above
it and sentinels were stationed about the place so
that the Greeks should not surprise and attack them.
After this all the people returned into the city and
the solemn funeral feast was held in Priam&rsquo;s palace.
Thus the Trojans paid honor to the body of great
Hector.</p>
